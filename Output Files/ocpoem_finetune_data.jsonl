'cogs' is a stronger and terser poem but 'her ballad' suffers from poeticising inversion as well as ungrammatical language ie 'the pain that he had bore' - this should read 'borne'. comments on your commentary the commentary is wrongly set in single spacing though prose for this module is supposed to be set in double spacing. thogh there are a few quite well made arguments the commentary generally ignores the course materials, does not use quotations from any of them in support and does not provide a bibliography. many thanks in advance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[\"passage of time\", \"life and aging\", \"family and responsibility\", \"work and societal expectations\", \"love and loss\"]"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "this was the first text i tried to write, and i would like to share it to receive opinionscriticism to continue improving you can hate someone you never loved, but you can't love someone who made you hate... hatred can arise quickly and without much explanation. but...love, love can appear suddenly and become something immense, it can be something that has always been there, but hidden, waiting for some way to appear. but what happens when only love ends, why? love only ends if somewhere, it stops being felt, disappears... and finally ceases to exist. but...why? sometimes due to a lack of trust, betrayal, or fear of loving, perhaps many people feel afraid of loving and giving themselves, of getting hurt once again, a fear that comes from past stories, or even childhood traumas. in some cases, there are people who love their partner so much, that they forget to love themselves, and forgive the unforgivable, just so as not to run the risk of losing the person they love, thus not giving themselves the value they deserve, because love is not just love, but carries other feelings along with it, such as happiness, trust and sometimes, even... sadness, which shows that love is not just a feeling, but something much deeper. loving someone can often be liberating, it makes you breathe better, it makes you feel alive... but in many cases it can be a nightmare, because everything that begins one day has an end, and so with love. it doesn't matter if it will be in 1 month, 10 years or just when death arrives, but the end always comes. especially in love transformations can happen. you've seen cases where love turns to hate, but why does this happen? hate is the echo of a wounded love it's the last noise that remains, after someone destroys what we felt. each person copes differently. there are people who give themselves completely and show it a lot, but there are also people who love in silence, without knowing how to show it, but both ways are still love. but...what is hate? hate, like love, is also a feeling. hatred can nullify love, just as love can nullify hate. from the moment you love and are blinded by love, everything becomes a wonder. seeing it like this can be an incredible thing, but... it's not, when you're blind, you don't see things that hurt you, and you ignore all of this, which eats away at you more and more, but when love ceases to exist, you return to seeing things that were previously invisible, but invisible only to your eyes. things that before you overlooked just because, love, and it is a very deep and intense feeling, hate is the opposite of love, and both can be felt in the same way, some can see hate as the reaction of pain, which is felt when someone provokes it, and is intrinsically linked to our way of living. but hatred can arise in many ways, either through traumatic experiences such as betrayal, frustration, rejection, or linked to things that happened in childhood. it can be a way to protect yourself from feelings that are more vulnerable, like love... love often turns into hate, because when you love too much, you become vulnerable to another person, and when the person does something that destroys you emotionally, hate can appear. so...maybe hate is nothing more than a desperate cry from someone who once loved too much. as the heart cannot love anymore, it is in hate that it finds a way to disappear completely. but love is taking risks, the risk of giving yourself completely, of losing yourself and even of being disappointed, but it is also the risk of finally finding yourself, even if love ends, it will still leave marks, which the brain will try to erase, but the heart cannot. but one truth is that love doesn't end, it just changes place, it stops being a feeling and becomes a memory, it stops being in the other person and starts being in us. it's no matter how much hate tries to shout louder, love still whispers, it doesn't go away easily, because love, even if very hurt, still knows how to be silence... it still knows how to be longing. and perhaps, deep down, the greatest tragedy is not the end, but realizing that even after everything you still feel because feeling, loving, hating, suffering is proof that we are truly alive, the same heart that loves and hates, is what refuses to be indifferent, seeing from another perspective, hate may not be the opposite of love, but rather indifference... and loving, even when it hurts, is still existing deeply. perhaps that is why, as sartre would say, \"hell is other people\" not because they make us suffer, but because they make us feel, they make us face who we really are. and in that abyss between love and hate, between the desire to forget and the desire to remember, maybe what's left... just be the human in us."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[\"love and hate duality\", \"emotional vulnerability\", \"trust and betrayal\", \"memory and transformation\", \"existential human experience\"]"}]}

her epilepsy. a condition she never asked for. a condition that turned my father's eyes into knives and my mother's into wells of endless grief. each seizure felt like watching her soul flicker away, while i stood as her shield. she wasn't at fault for what life and god gave her. she deserved tenderness, not disgust. but in our house, love was a foreign language none of us ever learned. then my mother got pregnant when i was in high school. my brother was born, and i knew instantly my life would never belong to me. i had to protect him too. i had to give up my own dreams to save his. i gave up my dream of becoming an architect . i chose software engineering, not because it made me feel alive, but because i believed it might save us. i thought money might finally buy us silence, a moment of air. but i failed. i failed my second year. and with that, the last piece of me splintered. i felt the word worthless echoing through my bones like a curse. not smart enough. not good enough. just a disappointment wearing a human face. my friends? they drifted away like smoke. they never cared enough to stay. they didn't sit with me in my darkness. they didn't reach out when i vanished. they didn't love me enough to fight for me. they left, and i let them go, because somewhere deep down... i believed i wasn't worth staying for. i isolated myself. i stopped speaking. i went to work, came back to my silent room, sat with the ghosts inside me. i stopped living. i became a shell. even when i got the amazon internship a prize everyone else would celebrate i felt nothing but fear. fear that i would fail again. fear that everyone would finally see what i really am empty, broken, an imposter in borrowed skin. i always had to be the perfect daughter. smile. hold everything together. be the wall that stopped the house from collapsing. but under that mask, there is only darkness. pain so deep it echoes when i breathe. loneliness so sharp it carves into my ribs at night when i can't sleep. i was never the chosen one. never beautiful. never the girl someone looked at and thought, \"she's the one.\" i'm 22 and i've never had a boyfriend. never felt chosen. never felt safe in someone's arms. i watch people my age fall in love, build lives, laugh so easily and i feel like a ghost pressed against the glass of a life i'll never touch. i couldn't tell my mother everything. she was already drowning in her own wounds. she broke me too, and i kept letting her, because that's all i knew. my father... maybe he is broken too. maybe he deserves forgiveness. but i can't find it in me to give it. he was supposed to protect me. instead, he became the monster i feared, and the love i still secretly longed for. now, i am stronger. not afraid of him. but forgiveness? i don't know if that will ever come. life is unfair. and sometimes, it is unforgivable. i was always overweight. they mocked me. they pointed. no one ever saw me. they only cared when i was the \"smart one.\" not the broken girl behind the grades. i never had carefree afternoons. never ran around with friends. i stayed home. helped my mother. watched every seizure. watched my own reflection fade into nothing. i think i was never whole. maybe i never will be. something inside me shattered so long ago, and now there's just a dark emptiness that keeps growing. i started smoking. i swore i never would. but now, it is the only thing that hushes the screaming in my head for a few moments. i struggle with bulimia. the endless cycle binge, guilt, purge, shame. i whisper, tomorrow i'll be better. but tomorrow never saves me. i look in the mirror and see something unlovable. fat. ugly. broken. never enough. not smart enough. not beautiful enough. sometimes, i think about ending it all. if i could choose to be born again? i wouldn't. maybe then my mother would have had a better child. a better life. a better husband. life is unfair. i gave up my childhood. my dreams. my softness. and what did i get? a life where i am nothing but a caretaker. a life where i am a ghost, drifting through other people's needs, never seen, never held. what can a broken soul give? only sharp pieces that cut too deeply. no one wants to hold something that bleeds. so every day, i wear my mask. i smile. i pretend. but inside, i am this close this close to disappearing. but i don't. because too many lives depend on me. my brother. my sister. my mother. i carry them all inside my fractured chest. i will keep sacrificing. even when there is nothing left to give. and now... i don't know how much of me is left. i don't know if there is anything left at all. i was the top student once. the girl everyone believed in. now, i am a ghost wearing her old skin. a quiet tragedy no one wants to see. i don't know if i will ever feel enough. i don't know if i will ever feel loved. but i keep going. because i don't know how to live for me. i only know how to live for them. maybe one day... maybe... i will look back and see that i was not weak. that i was a warrior a silent, invisible warrior who carried worlds inside her ribs while pretending to be fine. a warrior who stayed when all she wanted was to disappear. a warrior who deserved love, warmth, and a home even if she never received it. but today?

growing old i never thought i'd watch the fold of skin, of days, of sky and grace i lived too fast to face my face but then you came, and time grew near not sharp, but soft, not grave, but clear you let me see what years could hold a quiet room, your hand to hold 'til my time runs out 'til my breath is spare, 'til my bones fall deep into disrepair let the clocks run south, let the body tear, i don't mind, i don't care you're my can't without 'til my time runs out. i never dreamt of thinning hair of pills in cups or porchlight prayer of leaning more than i once stood of being seen and being good but now i wish for every pain that comes from loving you again the slippers worn, the kettle's sigh the mornings where we're eye to eye 'til my time runs out 'til the blade grows dull 'til the moon casts doubt on the beautiful 'til my hands can't feel 'til my limbs are peeled you're my only route 'til my time runs out no choir waits, no gates of gold just wrinkled hands i long to hold a whisper clothed in linen's weight your shoulder bowed beside the gate and if i break before the end i pray to break where you begin to fall, to kneel, to be remade within the furnace of your shade 'til my time runs out 'til my spine is thread 'til the sky forgets what the thunder said 'til my time runs out 'til the curtains fade 'til i'm just the sound that your memory made you're my vow, my drought, my wine, my bread i am yours, devout 'til my time runs out i used to want the flame, the flight not this slow grace of shared goodnight but now i crave the softer ache the soup we spill, the pills we take the wrinkled sheets, the morning cough the cardigan you never wash the way you laugh with only eyes the truth that outlives all disguise 'til my pain has mouth 'til my lungs won't fill and the stars burn out on my windowsill i will keep your light, 'til the sun unwrites you're my can't without 'til my time runs out. i never dreamed of age or end but now i hope to just descend through dusk and doubt, through loss and truth a pilgrim held in the arms of you you're my time you're my last you're the thing i meant to ask but never said and now i do i want to spend what's left with you you're not my fate you're not my proof you are my soul when it tells the truth --- for kait you came that fall when light was thin curtains drawn, the hush came in i had two hearts still sore with doubt you kissed their crowns, you washed them out no flowers thrown, no reasons why just i to you and you to i you moved in slow, with thyme and thread lit up the lamp, unmade the bed you swept the dark into a pile you braided silence, made it smile no ring, no vow, no wedding cry just i to you and you to i i tried to bring you sky in spoons i sang your name through empty rooms i built a boat from broken pine and held it up like it was fine i caught the stars but they slipped by still i to you and you to i still i to you and you to i my children knew you not by name but by the way you blessed their shame they brought you drawings, you brought them calm you sang in thread, you preached in balm no mother's robe, no alibi just i to you and you to i no mother's badge, no need to try just i to you and you to i no crown you wore, no war you fought you mended what the world forgot you made the porch a sacred place you brewed the tea, you blessed the grace no altar lit, no angels nigh just i to you and you to i i tried to carve your sleep in gold i kissed your feet when nights grew cold i brought you bells that wouldn't ring i dressed your hurt in linen things i came with hands, not wings to fly still i to you and you to i still i to you and you to i i loved you, not for grace, nor for the light behind your face. i loved you like the earth loves rain no reason, and no right to claim. i vowed to pour your every need into a bowl my hands would feed but breath grew thin and shoulders shy still i to you, and you to i still i to you, and you to i i brought you pearls from basement shelves i sang you songs i wrote myself i tried with all i had to give to build the life you'd want to live the fruit went soft, the well ran dry but not your gaze and not your sky your love for me refused to die just i to you, and you to i i laid your name in fields of rye i built a quilt of lullaby i failed to give what kings could not but still you stayed, and still you sought my reach fell short, but not my try still i to you and you to i still i to you and you to i no god was carved no myth was tied no golden law no serpent guide no veil was torn no voice replied just i to you and you to i the world moves on, the stars go blind. i leave this truth, not sealed, but signed we stayed. we gave. we said goodbye. just i to you and you to i. so tell them this when i am done i loved one woman. only one. no savior came. from up on high. just i to you you to i --- for liya there will be a night when i am gone no soft goodbye, no light left on. you'll touch the chair, the book i read, the coat that held my thinning thread. you'll search the rooms i left behind, find ash where once you looked for mind. but love is not a voice or face it lives in how you leave a place. i was not a steady man. i made no maps. i broke the plan. but you were light and rope and wheel you taught me what i could not feel. where i would vanish, be still, stay where i would curse, learn to pray. where i was small, rise and grow i could not lead, do not follow. my winter crown, my falling down, my soft ravine. my winged ascent, my sacrament, my canopy. my midnight sail, my comet's tail, my holy key my untied rope, my arc, my hope, my trampoline. say little when the world shouts loud. don't plant your flag in every crowd. make gentleness your kind of bold. let wisdom be the hand you hold. refuse the crown that shuns the weight. forgive too soon, don't love too late. and when they mock your heart's true song, sing higher still, sing until they're gone. kneel beside the parts i broke give them names, give them oak. and where i tried to hide the loss, kiss the flaws, wear the cross. my angel's kneel my sword made shield my blind's unsee my holy rite my second light my offering my thunder spark my lift from dark my trampoline my mother's height my northern lights my trampoline. so let them build their towers tall you'll know the truth that splits them all what rises up must rise in grace, and never seek the higher place. you'll love a man, and break apart you'll hold your child like precious art you'll speak to god and hear no sound you'll build a truth from empty ground when sorrow comes, as sorrow will don't chase the echo, keep the still let mourning be a kind of song not proof of loss, but proof of long. and when they come to weigh my story, and the hourglass runs thin, tell them i was just a shadow that your light invited in my winter fire, my perfect choir, my sorrow's thief my kite's lapel my citadel my heart's serene my trembling wings my echoing my love made steam my joy, my girl my whole, my world my trampoline --- for my mother holy is your flour hand holy are the jars you canned holy is the scraped-out pan holy is holy is the

is holy yours the voice i keep holy in the dark and deep holy now, and when i sleep holy is --- for kaiyaan they laid you down in my arms, still wet with god, still free from harm. your breath was small, your silence wide a sea i couldn't step inside. your fingers moved, a kind of hymn, the light bent softly at the rim. and i stood dumb, without a claim too close to love to speak its name. you found my hand, you held it fast as if we'd always shared a past. you were made of light, you knew the weight i couldn't hide from you. i made you promises i feared, they came out cracked, they disappeared. but every vow, though worn and thin, was how your father let you in. when the stars seem distant and your wings feel too thin when the gates are all golden but they won't let you in i will lift up the heavens if it tears me in two just to watch you keep climbing the way dreamers do i pray you choose the harder grace to stand when fear would take your place. to give when giving makes you bleed. to plant kindness like a seed. to be what i could never be less bound by shame, more openly. to walk into the storm and stay with quiet strength and no display be kind when no one writes it down. be loyal in a faithless town. let mercy be your only boast. let love remain when hope is lost. don't measure good by what it pays. don't count the nights. just walk the days. if the only gold that ever stays is what you give, then give it away. when they say that you're foolish for the size of your hope when you climb past the treetops with your soul tied to rope i'll be whispering steady through the branches and blue as you grow into thunder the way dreamers do now when you speak, the sky comes near. you bring the dark, but not the fear. and i, who chased a thousand stars, just watch you rise, right where you are and you stand where i once stood but taller, kinder, twice as good. you speak the words i never found, and lay them gently on the ground. i held you like a question now you hold me like a door and where i used to lead your steps you lead me somewhere more when your dreams make you lonely and they don't understand when the stars feel too fragile to hold in your hand i'll be holding the silence til it sings just for you and you'll walk into wonder the way dreamers when my hands are forgotten and my voice is just dust when the ledger is closed and the iron has rusted remember this promise i lived to lift you to the heights of your longing the way dreamers do for kait my heart is a beetle, in the dark of your shoe you walk. it hums, it follows you no other place for it to beat no other home than at your feet a kiss was once a place to hide. a bed was just the other side. i never knew what morning meant. always gone before it spent. i wore some names i wore some coats i burned like wool i sank like boats, the dreams i sang were songs to sleep no cradle ever held them deep. but you - you stood like something true. i turned away. as i used to. i feared the place where longing goes. i knew your name i chose the road. you waited like the sky waits rain and all my longing turned to flame. now every lie i ever kissed burns like sugar on your wrist. love, take this ring it's not for show. it's what i found when i let go it's what i earned for all the pain a kind of grace a holy stain it isn't gold. it doesn't shine. it only fits your hand in mine. no other way, no other way to get to you, no other way take this hand. it's out of tune. it held the knife. it touched the moon. it shook like sin but not today. it's waited long for this, to say i've nothing left i need to prove. but now i know what hands can move. no other way, no other way no other thread. no finer line. my heart, a flower you made mine to press between your book of days, or let it blow in other ways. i think of us, old, bent and slow. your silver hair, the window's glow. my fingers cold, your laugh, a bell. we fall asleep. we fall so well. no other way. no other sound. no sweeter ache than what we found. no other way. no final sky. just you and meand what won't die no other way, no other way to get to you, no other way --- for kait mountains used to hold me like a mother holds a child now they crumble into shadows and the road runs lonesome, wild but your love remains like moonlight on the backs of trembling waves and if there's a god, he wrote your name in the marrow of my days and this love has grown so deep it wakes me from my sleep just to whisper this \"in your love there is all the heaven above all the truth, all the love\" i walked through hollow chapels let the echoes be my call but i never heard salvation like your footsteps down the hall oh, your body was jerusalem when i had nowhere to stand and if there's a god, he placed your hand in mine, not to command not to save me, nor enslave me just to help me understand... this love has grown so deep it wakes me from my sleep just to whisper this \"in your love there is all the heaven above all the truth, all the love\" and if there's a god, he never showed me never sent the rain in sheets never played a chord upon me never danced between the streets not to move me, not to mould me not to name the love i keep just left me by your window to watch you fall asleep... i don't deserve your kindness that's why it's holy, i suppose in the darkness of my blindness your light is all i've come to know --- for kait i was dust in the hall silent and small before your sweet love my heart so bone thin, just a ghost haunting skin until your sweet love you were shelter and shrine where the holy things shine my sacred sweet love in the sweep of your hand, i was dust turned to man, knelt to sweet love raised to the sky, pulled to the light, of your sweet love. we'll dance on the sands waves in our hands, endless sweet love til my days come undone in the threads of the sun burn me sweet love when i'm nothing but light in the last stretch of night hold me, sweet love when the world breaks in two as only worlds do release me, sweet love when roots hold my bones and my flesh is unsewn know this sweet love that though i be gone as dust to the dawn our love will be air, everywhere, everywhere --- for kait morning through the screen door, coffee steam rising slow your hands around your blue mug, like roots beneath the snow. and every little sparrow, since the day we met, has been singing something holy, i can't forget. i testify, i testify, to my love, oh my love. every breath, every light, every shadow in the night, i testify, i testify. to the way you fold the sheets, how your bare feet meet, the wooden floor at dawn, like deer through morning fields, like time when it yields, soft and strong. i testify, i testify, to my love, oh my love. every ache, every wound that brought me to your room i testify, i testify. to the dust motes in the window, paint peeling on the sill, to the way you make them wait, when you feed the dogs so still. to the twilight that will take my voice, to the autumn leaves of gold, love is written in the silence like a story never told. between the tooth and tongue of time, between the mountain and the pine, between the creature and the road, i lay my heart in your hands to hold. and when they ask what saves us, from the spinning dark of night, i'll tell them how you showed me, that love invents the light. i testify, i testify, to my love, oh my love. your love, so warm and wide tears the sky, with holy light i testify, i testify. and i'll testify, and testify, for all my life..."}, {"role": "assistant",
