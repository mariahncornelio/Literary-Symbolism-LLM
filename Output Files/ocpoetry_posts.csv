A Puddle's Whisper,PappaSmurfXIV,"You fall into a puddle  of resentment and tears.  Your life’s being soaked  with all your worst fears.    Grasping at reality,  trying to make sense —  everything feels like a lie,  left in the dark, in suspense.    The puddle grows deeper,  love crumbles — you drown.  The water’s at your knees,  rising fast, pulling down.    The puddle starts to whisper;  you slowly become friends.  It hisses, “Be angry, lash out,”  but your conscience transcends.    Don’t become a victim  of the puddle’s abyss.  Stay true to your heart —  that’s where you’ll find bliss.    Your values are strong,  though the puddle is deep.  Just keep above water,  till you’re ready to leap.    You grab for the ledge,  pulling yourself free.  The puddle clings to your ankles —  but you kick, break, and breathe.    Overcome with emotion,  you let go — you’re free.  The puddle melts away,  and at last, you see:    No puddle’s too deep,  though it feels without end.  You’re stronger than you know —  all wounds can mend.

The Last Light,Potential-Walrus-885,"7 months have come and gone  Time to pack my bags and move on  I'll turn this last light off in the house  Close the door and build from the ground  Heartache isn't in me  Hasn't been in a while  You said, ""Ask, you never know""  But the question I would ask  I already know  You avoid any emotion  That comes with me  Because deep down  You know you miss me   So for you and me  I'll turn this last light off in the house  That way, I no longer hear the sound  Or see your face when I close my eyes  This final shift will be my final goodbye  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/djcaN5bNrB https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/nmV72tTC02"
While You Were in Japan,Dogdydaycare_,"You were already waking up as I was crying myself to sleep. 14 hours ahead, but somehow always behind in the things that mattered.  We called— but only when I asked. We texted— but only if I reached out first. And even then, your replies felt like I was pulling teeth from a ghost who used to hold me like I was the only thing real.  I thought the time difference was the reason. I excused it with jet lag, with classes, with culture shock. But I couldn’t ignore how I was always the one trying to close the distance while you let it grow.  Back home, I sat with your brothers— watched them love so loudly. How they planned little things, called their partners “my girl,” smiled when their phones lit up. I saw what it looked like when someone *wanted* to be wanted.  They told me we were great together. Said they hoped it would work. But then they looked at me— at the way I poured myself into you with wide eyes and open hands, and at how you kept yourself tucked away, like a secret I wasn’t meant to know fully.  They noticed how I was the sunshine in a room you never let light in. How I talked about you like a poem I was proud to write, and you barely said a word about me even before you left.  And maybe the worst part is that I *knew* this. Deep down, I felt it— every time I reread our texts hoping to find something that felt like trying.  But I kept going. Because you held me after someone else broke me, and I confused that for love. I thought anyone willing to stay with all my damage must mean it.  I didn’t want to believe that you liked the idea of me more than the day-to-day of loving me.  But I see it now.  I wasn’t asking for too much. I was asking the wrong person.

Lost Girl,QueenofGreen79,"Nobody knows about the girl who sits alone in the dark.  She's sad and alone, but playing her part.  Day after day, each as empty as the last.   A husband who's long lost interest.  A grown son who could not care less.   She's surrounded by them, but never more alone and unseen.  Missing and craving the most simplest of things.  She's mastered putting on a show, happiness so easily portrayed.  Deeper into the darkness she goes.  She's the girl that nobody knows, and the one that nobody sees.  ___________________________________________ https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7QyMvxJ9vx  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/1MMRObr1hk"

"Sunset on Sixth Street Viaduct, 2103 by Claude Monet",harroldinho,"context: Claude Monet's 1903 waterloo bridge painting series featured heavy smog which highlighted the poor air quality of the time in London.

Fingers for heads,Dazzling_Many_498,"I don’t know, but Ive heard it been said,  theres an island where the people all have fingers for heads.   No eyes to see, no mouths to say,  they only know when they touch- not to play.   They press their hands, onto fire and stone,  to feel the pain, and to make it known.   Babies crawl, learning touch is love,  feeling what words can’t really speak of.   They don’t talk much, they read by feel,  what’s held, what’s lost, and which cuts heal.   and If you stay too long, you might forget—  that to show, is how to speak   Till your face is just hands,   feeling round in the dark,  reaching and looking,   just trying to spark.     ₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩  I refuse to elaborate.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/WozOcBWxsB  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NKkrGIXmVC"

Bedroom: my first poem 07/23,AffectionateLand9084,"The air is covering my mind.   I’ve stitched my emotions into the bedsheets,   using a pattern I hoped to make a new reality.   Now I cry waiting for someone to save me.   Why does no one hear me?   Of course, my words never touch my lips;  it’s much too lonely to speak, to let someone in.    I live in others.  In their grief, body.   I live in their love and death,   their war that splits my obsolete body in two.   Tell me stories;   let my bedsheets drip in vehemence   Let me soak in sentiments that I can live within.    The overhead ceiling fan spins my fanaticism,   my depraved convictions drown me   in the walls of my bedroom.   The dust gathers as an homage to long-forgotten fears   in the windows of my boredom.    I know not much, though I manipulate oxygen   to breathe a little easier,   to feel my mortality under gods of solitude.   Lay next to me and let me cover you in my allegories;   after all, I cannot speak.   Let the flickering lightbulb I’ve yet to change submerge   you.

Out of Order Oubliette,zyerhod1,"**Out of Order Oubliette**   *by Bryon Slack*  In my youthful vanity,   not yet confronted   by the face of Time   that takes,   I boasted of an oubliette   in my soul—   where I could bury   any secret,   or toss away   any suffering   into an endless abyss   and be meaningless.  I discarded the detritus   of the day to day—   here a brick,   there a stone,   perhaps a sonnet or two   on the flaws   in my character.  Housefuls of soil   were shoveled in   with barely a thought.   I could take it all—   no pain I couldn't   make drop.  Years have a way   of making liars   of our bravest declarations.  The pit I had praised   as proof of strength   was only a waiting silence,   compressed into shape.  And so it was—   hand over hand,   thrown over shoulder   with never a glance—   until the first brick   clattered back out   of the buried vault   of malcontent.  I had nowhere left to put it.  The fire began to smolder   in my veins, crimson   edges began framing my vision.   The shackled form   of my father's memory   began to howl in laughter—   that I was always bound   to be him—   from his cell deep within   the iron corridors   of my mind.  And I knew then—   what I’d built was no oubliette,   but a vault with pressure doors—   and somewhere, something   had finally cracked.       **Feedback:**   [""When the Ticking Gets Louder""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1me8ump/comment/n67l8fq/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""After the Storm""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mdkvf4/comment/n62keqg/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   "

Blow and Handshake,loceapeace,"  The stain on the floor resembled a question, left untouched, fading out. Boxed-in air stifled a laugh, invisible rules lost shape, and pain—adrift outside—forgot its meaning.  Along a corridor meant only for passing, the sound of torn cuffs rang oddly sincere. Heels stepped down out of habit, dragging a sound that never fully arrived. Footsteps slipped into silence as everyone competed to perfect the act of not noticing. Among them, who was it that won the game of not looking?  Everyone whispered “I didn’t see” as if in prayer, lips folding contradiction with a straight face. Only my anger held heat. Why should silence still earn forgiveness?  Inside a sealed theater, a voice refusing its role posed the question: who, here, is mad? When the question faded and clung to the wall, the wall, unusually gentle, accepted it. Only the air that observed remained calm, untouched by madness.  Where running was no longer an option, my feet stopped for no reason. The exit was sealed— yet a stain in the book’s margin remained free. And watching it, I felt no reason left to run.  Within an overwritten framework, the pain assigned to me was given without weight, and removed with even less. Only the question soaked into the floor, leaving behind no voice, only the trace of its delay.  No one shared the pain. I stepped over the question for my own convenience. Convenience— always easy to notice in hindsight. A returning gaze stabbed me in the back. Who failed to see? Perhaps it isn’t the act, but the footprint that followed, that cannot be forgiven.  Beneath the desk, the boy’s name went unwritten. His anger, meaningless, dried quietly. There, a cold vacancy spread. The fist I threw caught only air— and I realized it was never a blow, but a handshake with nothing. The seat, still empty, warped its outline, and the pain that had no way to ask faded— not reaching anyone— vanishing, slowly.    ---   Interpretive Poem｜Blow and Handshake      What appears here is not a voice gone unheard, but a question never granted permission to speak.  The floor’s purpose was to cover the carcass of the question. The corridor— to rob escape of reason. Even the sound of shoes had no right to be sincere.  “I didn’t see” was recited not as prayer but as contradiction. When the question finally clung to the wall, it was the wall— not the speaker— that received it carefully.  This is where ethics broke. The blow and the handshake switched roles. Anger shook hands with air. The handshake became a perfected form of violence.  Pain was distributed without name, without origin. No one stole the voice— but all footprints stepped on the question. Everyone complicit. Everyone witness.  The boy’s name was erased. The empty seat grew larger. When his anger finally dried, no one asked what caused it.  The fist, once raised, grasped only silence. And in that moment, you, the reader, held the same question in your hands.  This poem offers no answers, no redemption. It is a blow shaped like a question, and a handshake shaped like silence.  It rejects your ethics. Slows your comprehension. Spirals just before you arrive.  So what you held— was not air. It was the question. Still trembling. Not yet gone.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "

Poem about cheating and feeling like a victim of myself,BellAppropriate7836,"I never wanted all these sexual things, and still they destroyed the one true love I had. It feels like a drug – a drug I’m not addicted to, but many people on Earth are. And the Devil searched for this drug in me, but I didn’t refuse to give it to him, so it’s still my fault. Because you should only give it to people you love. Some people love and some people hate this drug. I hate it so much, because every time I give it to somebody, I feel like the love disappears. But the night when I gave it to the Devil, there was no love between me and him – but between me and my only true love – and so that love disappeared that night. I gave the drug to the Devil and paid the consequences, even though I hate to give the drug – so I just got double the pain. And the worst thing is: once you give the drug to somebody, it can’t be returned. That decision stays with you till you die, including the consequences. I couldn’t say no. I wanted to, but I just didn’t know how to say the words. They’re so simple, but so hard to pronounce when I have to say them. I wish I could. And now I suffer – with the Devil forever a part of me. Consuming me everyday.  anonym-writer   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/wjDeSxsBKI  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/m49utDYeVc "

None of my poems are worthy of a title,Green_Event5141,"They thought I’d break. They watched me fracture— called it beauty, called it healing. But this isn’t healing. This is rot refined.  Every crack in me holds teeth. Every step I take is over graves dug with my own fingers. I buried the boy. I buried the believer. Now only the revenant remains.  I don’t need salvation. I need silence. And a blade sharp enough to carve out the noise in my head.  You talk about light? I’ve seen it. Flickering behind stained glass, held hostage by men with grins too wide. It never reached me. It never tried.  I speak to shadows now. They don’t lie. They don’t promise. They just exist— like me.  The mask isn’t for show. It’s my birthright. My curse. My shield. It tightens with each false hope I slaughter. It shines because I bled it clean.  I walk like the reaper forgot me. Like hell rejected my soul for being too stubborn, too cold, too real.  I’ve loved. I’ve kneeled. I’ve screamed into the mouth of God. No answer.  So I stopped asking.  Now I move. Not forward. Not back. Just through. Through the wreckage, through the noise, through the aching echoes of who I was.  And if something comes for me— another liar, another siren, another god in disguise?  Let it.

A Phone Call,Red5505,"I called you again, Two days late but I know you remembered, Hands instinctively dialed your number, An action made with precision, Thumbs move swift across the dial pad, Disobeying my brain, Listening to my heart, Aching for that voice the way silence begs to be broken.   A dead line is what was expected, Instead was hit with something different, A lifeline on the other side, Resounding sound that sent my heart a flutter, It rang—  Each chime growing louder  A sound I grieved like a ghost.  Ive made a thousand wrong turns, I finally see the flicker of headlights on the road,  Im chasing their glow, Hoping they lead me home.  The hourglass on the mantle froze midstream, Every ring echoing like a heartbeat my ears crave to hear, How long has it been my dear?  You picked up— My heart stopped— The earth stopped rotating, Like it knew how long I'd been waiting.  I rehearsed this moment in the mirror like a boy trying to be a man with something brave to say, Every line had to be perfect for you, But hearing that ringing again— Stage fright took my hand, Stole all the lines I had planned  Your voice broke down the dam, A river of memories comes rushing in— The park, The car, You and your guitar, Blueberry wine and laughter stained lips, Those Cinnamon Sunburst eyes and midnight drives, Chasing adventure under city lights.  Three hours went by, in a flash, Your voice was softer than I remember, Almost tired but still kind, You asked how I'd been— I wanted to hear about you, Still I nearly told you everything.  Maybe this is nothing, Just an echo of what once was But even an echo can carry some truth, And I heard it in your silence— You missed me too.

Left in the gaze,1bt1ss3m_bgh,"You were walking. I was looking. You walked past me . At that moment, time failed to move, it felt like eternity.  Our souls crossed so deeply that everyone noticed it. Neither of us would admit it. But our nonchalance already did.  Everyone was searching for something through our gazes. Something already gone as it slipped away. Something that once set my soul ablaze.  Perhaps it was the warmth that bloomed when our souls collided. The love we proudly carried for each other that year. Somehow, that love still resounds in me my dear. But I won’t let it appear. Not due to the fear. Perhaps out of something as aching as the memory of your touch. And god knows how I’m still craving it just as much.

When the Ticking Gets Louder,ghostpoett,"I used to think old people showed up early to church   because they were holy—   but now I wonder if it’s because they’re scared.   like maybe showing up every sunday   feels like scrubbing their soul one last time   before the dirt settles for good.  we all start praying more   when our clocks stop feeling infinite.   when the ticking gets louder—   like it’s not measuring time,   but what little of it we have left.   we bow our heads not just to worship,   but to listen.   like maybe God speaks between the seconds.  maybe belief isn’t always about faith—   maybe it’s about fear.   the kind that hides in hospital rooms,   lingers at funerals,   and curls up beside us   during late-night prayers we whisper out of habit.   not knowing who’s listening—   but speaking anyway,   just in case silence means we’re alone.  when we’re young,   we wear time like a rumor—   something that’ll never catch up.   we skip the sermons,   call fear “faith,”   and laugh at the thought of the end.   but even then,   some part of us wonders   what happens when the clock runs out.  maybe I’m just scared too,   but I dress it up in metaphors.  and so, we pray more   as the ticking gets louder.   as if forgiveness has a deadline.   the older we get,   the more we rehearse our exits—   hoping someone’s waiting on the other side.  feedback links:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ro2u/comment/n4fz6z6/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ro2u/comment/n4fz6z6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mabqlu/comment/n5dhr65/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mabqlu/comment/n5dhr65/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  "

Independent Blue,OldAcanthisitta8215,"(Revised)  Dandelions,  reaching through  the cracks to bloom,  pay yellow dues  to sun’s deluge —  a challenge met in solitude. *** While oceans sleep  like lions do,  daring waves  to dive down through  their shade that keeps  the rays subdued. *** Beneath its blaze,  the ice caps wade  with shoulder turned  from stellar burn,  returning gold  in cold rebuke. *** A glowing face,  in cosmic view.  The dark of space  behind it grew. *** Despite the calm,  rebellion brews—  in a soul that smolders  stubborn truths. ***  From daybreak’s call  to twilight’s bruise,  bearing life  in muted hues. *** Like weathered green  under skies that brood,  whispering trickles  of earned refuge. *** Against the world, with nothing to prove,  She stands defiant  in Independent Blue.

An Ode to the Fallen Artist,Confident-Beyond-139,"Can you separate the art from the artist?  I do not care.  .  That is the wrong question.   The better question is:  Did you ever separate the art from the artist?   .  Great art speaks to us.   For a moment, things are clear.  We love this clarity.  We rejoice in its reflection of life - perhaps a reflection of us.   And then, it's gone.  .  So, we cling to that moment of clarity, even as it fades.   That love turns to fear.   Terrified to move forward into the blurry.   we stay put  .  Their art becomes a numbing agent  A freeze frame of meaning.  We rejoice at their despair.   Their sickness, we call raw and authentic.   Their pain, we call enlightening.  .  We lock away our love.  Too painful to stare at the reflection.  We crave the blurry.  We create a caricature of their pain.  .  Are we captive to the whims of erratic artists,   or captors of an idealized manifestation of their torment?  .  The greatest triumph — and the ultimate blight — for an artist is to make it big.   Their art becomes immortal — and dead.  .  *And the artist?*  .  Cursed to go on tour and parade around a shred of who they once were.   Trapped between a will to create and longing to conform.   .  Can you separate the art from the artist?  We never wanted to.  We just didn’t want them to be real       [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mdzd87/comment/n66yqqe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1me61oi/comment/n670c5k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Two in a dream,Ok_Manufacturer_195," Everywhere I look couples. Smiling. Perfect. Or so it seems.  I know storms rage behind closed doors, but still, I ache.  When will it be my turn to give someone a reason to glow? To share a glance, a kiss, a private universe of inside jokes?  I have become what I never dreamed the one alone, the wandering uncle, a ghost on the water.  Yet in every dream there are always two.  And some nights, I fear I will drift forever with no one to anchor me home.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/jwxvjFRMV8  https://www.reddit.com/r/Original_Poetry/s/HR34USo12W"
The Snack Aisle Sermon,theliminalfox," *(Her POV)*  I went in for one thing.   Just one.      But the air conditioning hit different,   the fluorescent lights were too loud,   and the moment   I saw your favourite chocolate bar,   it started.      Then the drink you always reach for.   The crisps with the flavour   you said tastes like childhood.   The stupid lollies you pretend not to like   but always finish first.      I wasn’t even hungry.   I just… couldn’t choose.      Because everything felt a little like you   and none of it felt like enough.   So I bought it all.      No ceremony.   No explanation.   Just quietly lined them up   on the kitchen counter   like a confession   you weren’t supposed to see.      You didn’t say anything.   Just blinked once.   Then twice.   You let out a quiet chuckle,   the kind you didn’t know   you were holding   and smiled in that cute but crooked way   you do when you’ve been seen   too clearly.      I shrugged.   Said something dumb about indecision.      But the truth is?   This was never about snacks.      It was about knowing   what sweetness felt like   when I didn’t.      It was about memory   made edible.   It was about you,   and every small thing   you didn’t think   anyone noticed.      And now?   They’re all here.   In one ridiculous pile   because I couldn’t choose   just one way   to say   I missed you.  ---  **The Snack Altar Line-Up**   *(His POV)*  The kitchen smelled like cinnamon and summer rain   the late afternoon kind.   I hadn’t expected anyone to be home yet.      But there they were.   Stacked across the bench.   A lineup of snacks   with familiar colours,   silly fonts,   brightly coloured packaging   and the quiet weight   of being remembered.      My favourite drink.   The chocolate bar I joked about hoarding.   Those weird fruit chews   I only ever bought once   but apparently spoke volumes.      She didn’t say anything.   Just stood by the fridge,   shoulder angled,   like it wasn’t a big deal.      “I couldn’t decide,”   she said.      But I saw the care in the chaos.   The way each item wasn’t just a snack,   but a timestamp.   A signal.   A soft little mirror   of the version of me   I forgot could be loved like that.      I didn’t say thank you.   Didn’t know how to   without making it too much.      So I opened the chips   and handed them to her.      We smiled,   That was enough.      And maybe it was.      Because in that moment,   in that absurd, beautiful pile   of sweet and salty offerings,   I realised      she never needed   a reason   to remember me.      She just did.      And maybe   that’s what love is.      A pile of snacks   no one asked for.   But every single one   exactly right.  ---  **Author’s Note: The Echo Psalms**     The *Echo Psalms* are written as paired reflections   two voices, one moment.      Each set contains a *""His POV""* and a *""Her POV""*   not as binaries, but as emotional mirrors.      These are not separate poems.   They are breaths and returns.   Movements in duet.      Each pair is meant to be read as one:   one experience refracted,   one moment remembered twice,   softened by the other’s presence.      Let them unfold slowly.   Let them speak to each other,   as they speak to you.  ---  **Feedback**   [Feedback 1 – “Feeding Intrigue”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mdoykv/comment/n662w1e/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [Feedback 2 – “Haunting By Design”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mdjseu/comment/n667936/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) "
In Threes,Acceptable_Link_6546,"#   My mother used to say   Death comes in threes,   black cars parading in a row,   lilies wilting, one by one.      After the first eulogy,   she would sit stiff,   scanning obituaries   for names she knew,   counting omens,   naming signs.      Superstition,   I was sure.      But then I heard the crow   tap on the windowpane,   once,   twice,   three times --      and suddenly,   counting made sense to me.      KNOCK.      Robin Williams,   man of a thousand voices,   a mind like a firecracker   bursting across the stage,   sparks exploding   like gears in overdrive,   thoughts faster   than his tongue could catch.      I grew up with his epic whirlwind,   that manic improv genius wit,   filling my living room.      We flew to Agrabah,   him as Genie,   all laughter, smoke and magic.      Mork,   Ms. Doubtfire,   Patch Adams --   he brought fire to them all   and more.       But the greatest mask he ever wore,   was his smile   in the midst of his storm.      His was the first suicide   that ever truly shocked me.   When my friend said he'd died,   I couldn't believe   that much magic could   vanish from this world.      Later, after the tears,   I wondered:   if he couldn't survive this life,   what hope was there for me?      KNOCK. KNOCK.      Chester Bennington,   screaming frontman   for every metal-emo 2000s kid,   howling through headphones,   bleeding out survival.      Linkin Park was a lifeline --   his white-knuckled grip on the mic   roaring battle cries to the masses.   Every note of crawling anguish   reminded us we were not alone.       Shadows spiraled   through his confessions,   spotlight anthems lit his grief.   We sung to the despair in those chords,   lyrics mirroring our own in harmony.   But screams echoed so loud   they drowned the warning signs.      He became so numb.      And we played   that shit on beach trips.      He stood   one step closer to the edge,   with wounds that would not heal   and we tossed his raw rage   onto workout playlists,   and at concerts we all cheered.      How loud must you scream   to save yourself   from the silent microphone,   from the encore that never comes?   How do you not fall into the pit   when you're the lightning rod   for everybody else's pain?      In the end, does it even matter,   if nobody was listening?      KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.      Luke Jongebloed,   cousin, kin --   little blond-haired boy   teasing your brother in family photos.   You loved Grandma's chocolate pie,   tearing open presents on Christmas Eve,   but at reunions,   you kept to the edges,   as if you'd already slipped away.      We hadn't spoken in some time,   you had your life, I had mine --   But when I heard the news   that you'd decided not to stay,   I realized how much our fates   may be written in our genes.       If you'd seen the half-written letters,   the roulette wheels I've spun,   how I've unraveled in midnight spirals,   would you have known   you weren't alone?   Would you have understood   maybe some of this was inherited?      I always thought it'd be me first.      But there's the noose,   swinging from our family tree --   and it's not my neck that's in it.      Death came so close this time   his breath heavy on my neck,   as he stalked my family.       And in the silence that followed   who you were and what you did,   as dirt falls on your casket,   I'm reminded: Our family   is such easy prey, picked off   one by one.      But maybe I don't want to die,   even if   the darkness wants our blood?      And so we count,   like children reciting fables --      one.   two.   three.      My final breath   is a wolf   pacing just outside the door.      But if what my mother said is true,   if death comes in threes,   then maybe,   after all I've learned   from all we've lost,      maybe if I'm lucky,      next time   it won't come for me.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  1.

I Forgot to Listen to Myself,benammaster,What do I write…   when all I want   is to say something that’s mine?  I’ve waited too long   for others to understand—   now I just want to meet myself.  These talks of distance   have started to tire me out.   Maybe it’s time   to steal a little time   for myself.  I don’t know when   I last sat with my own silence.   But maybe now’s the time   to become a guest   at the doorstep of my own heart.   Feedback https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/WcLY4VIfa2 https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/XpBFV3KsrH
So what?,Dreamslyer,I carry doubt like a shadow that won’t leave. It walks with me sits beside me breathes louder than I want it to.  There’s so much I’ve wanted to be just to feel worthy. But I’m done chasing approval in places that never saw me.  I still get scared that maybe a good life won’t find me. But I won’t trade my soul just to feel wanted.  If I have to walk alone with trembling hands but my head held steady — so be it.  I’d rather live uncertain than bow for love that doesn’t know how to stay. .*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_ .

The Gardener,Smooth-Tie-5440,"I saw at the fruitless behemoth,   dark circles revealing its age,   once opaline petals now dull,   its beauty withered and lost,   and I, blithe, chastened by its thorns,   cut through with quiet dignity and denial.  Sparrows flitter amongst its arms,   still not disillusioned with its trappings;   perhaps only I, the gardener, witness   its faults, others like it producing   the returns of lesser labour; so,   I, unyielding, continue my cleaving.  Sweet sap now flows through its chest,   persistently draining what little remains,   still it stands, tall, lush, green,   woe betide he who hacks it away;   weeks of effort coalesce slowly, as   I, determined, stray no higher up.  Severance inches towards me, rapid,   the trunk merely a vestige now;   my eyes scale its height, and fixate,   aghast, at its once bejewelled crown;   it, mercurial, bears fruit once again, and   I, undone, falter, unable to rend further.  ———————  [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mdmk2h/comment/n65e3q7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mchndo/comment/n656quu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

Please Be Weird,wyndstorm77,"I like me a weirdo, someone who is a bit strange. It’s so fun to be yourself, even when others might think you’re deranged. We giggle and we laugh, always having a great time. While people on the outside wonder what is wrong with their minds.   I want to be free, free to scream and meow and soar. What’s the point of living if there’s nothing to live for? The truth is we’re all weird, whether we’ll admit it or not. We all have silly impulses and funny little thoughts.   If I were your doctor I’d say to you, “I prescribe to you some weird. Make sure to take it twice a day, or until your worries are cleared”. For in weirdness we are true, no more hiding or defeat. Weird is not an insult and to be yourself? Bro, that is such a sweet little treat.   So the next time you think “I can’t do that, it’d be super weird”. I encourage you to shake that thought. “Just do it!” I will cheer.   Don’t let your dreams be dreams, even if they’re strange or scary. Cause dude you might not know it, but you are a majestic ass fairy. Spread your joy, spread your weirdness, and your quirks.

Wanting warm touches,   mellowed eyes,   soft skies.  I am unravelled at this altar,  begging.  For forgiveness is a choice,  and if the god is fallible,  if it can be kind  then I am absolved.  .

What does it takes ?,Plenty_Mistake_9577,"What does it take to be a women? - I ask,   They said -   Spiritually - nothing  Biologically - a uterus   Societally -   .  When I was little with no sense in my thoughts,   Playing with my cars , eyeing my sister's dolls.  Wearing mom's lipstick making a crooked smile,  Too neat and I'll get beaten for crossing the line.  Rolling on the floor just to get one dress,   I couldn't understand the issue quite yet.  .  As I grew older my world split into two,   With a little beard it all came crashing through.  I ignored it, as if my soul didn't shatter,  Screamed 'I am a man' before my inner voice could rattle.   .  In a body that hung like some stranger's clothes,   I couldn't bear deafen the screams echoing at every shore.   They said my walk's a little girly, my voice is too low,  I felt ashamed, but should I be? I didn't know.   .  I just want to be girl and put ribbons in my hair,   wear a skirt and be gentle with myself.   I want my inner truth to be my outer shell,   breathe easy like I used to-  when pink and blue were just colors, not cells.  .  I am not a man, so don't call me a ""he"",  trapped in my body - struggling, unseen.   It's not a scar you can tend to,   or illness you can heal,  So I left my home when I was sixteen.    .  Stitched with courage, threaded by fear,  though shallow, i did make a tear.   for the first time, a weight was off my chest,   so I went to that party, knowing I shouldn't have.   And just like always they only saw a man,  This time wearing a pretty pink dress.   .  So I did it,   I shed the skin that never felt like mine,  And saw a reflection i could finally recognise.  With that I was given a new chance at life,   My place, my people and many reasons to smile.    .  'I am a women', is not just my truth,   It's my story.  The love letter I wrote,  The vow I lived ,   The dream i bled for,   A war I fought,  to love me.

Fairy's tale,Turtle_0D,"I thought I was an angel, Pretty, decent, and elegant. I believed I had magical power, So I could fulfill people’s desires.

Spent,ShootnSugar,This headache pounds in my skull.   Two coffees no water and no will to eat and its currently 938pm  I think I've been crying on and off since noon.  I feel like I gave all my effort away to my survival and forgot to save some small part to build my life beyond the struggle  Im 30 and I feel older than dirt.   Chat gpt says im tired and its not my fault. And its the most comforting thing I could hear right now.   Even though thats a sad thing to take solace in.

Growing up I was told  “stop growing!”  as if its something I can control  We want to hold time  with a tight squeeze of mortal hands  We fear death  and leaving our loved ones behind  We feel ourselves to be bound by the cruel demands of time  We forget about dying  And forget about  what happens in forgetting  So I close my eyes to remember what it means  to surrender to time  And I find it peculiar how we worship the  seasons with sweet treats and pumpkin lattes  Yet we look away when someone is grieving  and we choose to forget what time is teaching  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/e7UP6iVwDK  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/dkQJDbLoDo

Lily ponds,ssoulis,"Lily Ponds  How wonderful —  A deep tint of green, with flowers that bloom in sync.   Sitting on waters so bright you must blink.   Like a white smile and two lips,  But not as beautiful as tulips. I won’t lisp for the truth —  I won’t let myself be seen like this, not for a minute.  Not in admiration or vulnerability,  But in a state where I only wish for content.  Let me look at lily ponds in peace.  Let me admire from a distance.  Let me love the unlovable, and fall for the unthinkable —  Because I am flawed and bothersome, like frogs on lily ponds.  Only there to bother or to comfort,  Never to show what it truly means.  What does it truly mean?  Nothing more than sounds, but far more than words.  How I wish there were words —  How I wish I could go on to explain.  But not now.  I can let them float in peace.  I should not fall to pieces,  Or make myself taste like blue cheeses.  I should sit with feelings, without always needing.  But I will always fall —  Maybe not shatter,  But always ignore the latter, because…  Boy, do I miss it.  Watching the lily ponds.  How beautiful they are.  How calm I feel.  How I wish…  It were only real.

The silent storm,Top-Air461,"I wear a smile like borrowed skin, A mask to keep the demons in. They dance behind my weary eyes, And whisper truths disguised as lies.  The world moves on in golden light, While I dissolve in endless night. A shadow stretched across the floor, Too tired to fight, too broke to roar.  My heart, a house with shattered glass, Each breath a ghost that longs to pass. I scream, but sound won't ever form— It’s thunder trapped inside a storm.  They say, “You’re loved,” and maybe so, But love can’t reach where sorrows grow. It’s not your fault, it’s not neglect, It’s just a weight I can’t deflect.  I've built a smile, stitched every seam, But sink beneath this quiet stream. No one can see how deep it goes— The pain that hides in whispered throes.  So if I fade like autumn’s flame, Don't curse the wind or cast the blame. Just know I tried, with all my might, To hold the dark and chase the light.

Song of the wounded heart,Stalcko,"A flower blooms where sorrow sleeps, its color soft, yet brief,   Its petals kiss the soil below, where roots hold tight through grief. Though beauty fades, it blooms again, within the same old ground, The earth remembers every tear, and still, she makes no sound.  Above, the birds in silver arcs dare freedom with each wing, But winds can turn, and skies can dark, and storms begin to sing. To fly is more than joy alone; it's faith in staying high, When even light can lose its way across a trembling sky.  He holds the hours like brittle glass, afraid to let them fall, Each second shaped like something lost, or something not at all. He wants to cradle what he makes, yet breaks it in the end, A fear that even love, when born, is something to defend.  But gentle hands can gather light where others see just ash, And stitch the silence back to song with every softened flash. She doesn’t rush the broken stem, nor curse the evening rain, She only waits, and in her calm, the world can bloom again.  Now sky, soil, time and care, move easy side by side, Their burdens softened into song, no longer need to hide. They share the quiet, share the light, with laughter like the breeze, Even the old and wounded hearts can find a kind of peace.

Haunting by Design,zyerhod1,"**Haunting by Design**   **or ""Left on Read""**   *by Bryon Slack*  There is a foil   to my penetrating gaze—   silence.

Specters shaped   by the curvature of Desire,   etched with fear,   weighted by decades   of cynical observation.  My brushstrokes   of thought mistrace   the outline of your   state of mind,   from templates held   in the aperture   of my cerebellum.

THE PROMISE-WEIGHT,nagamidge,"Beneath the tent-ribs, Yamma’s breath a thread,   Ukhti’s small hand clutched cold in Amir’s own.   Thirteen hard years scourged his frame, a hunger-fed,   Gaunt architecture built of skin and bone.   He kissed her brow, “Ukhti, be strong for Yamma.”   The promise hung: Bread by the evening’s fall.   Twelve kilometres etched in Gaza’s drama,   A pilgrim tracing hope’s mirage-lined wall.    West Rafah called. His feet, bare maps of stone   Knew every shard, each rutted track and dune.   They say that place gives bread and death as one;   That bullets greet the starving every noon.   But Amir knew no other path to try-   He walked the razor edge where hopes undo.   The sun, a molten coin, beat flesh to bone,   A kiln where will alone held hunger true.    A river rose- gaunt bodies moving slow   Toward rumoured gates, where white men gave reprieve.   He joined the flow, let grief and worry go,   Fixed on one thought: What Yamma must receive.   The fence loomed stark. A crush of bone and sigh,   Sweat’s sting, the sand’s relentless burn and glare.   Hope choked the air, thick as the desert sky,   As hidden watchers tracked the tide of prayer.    Then came a groan- a surge, a sudden shout.   Amir slipped eel-like through the human stream,   Threaded the gaps where stronger men gave out,   And reached the front- a sliver of a dream.   A canvas chair. A man with hair like flax,   Hands giving parcels, sealed and clean and square.   Amir stepped up, received the precious stacks:   Flour’s pale promise, lentils’ sober care.   Joy, sharp and sudden, pierced the hollow ache.   He placed the burdens down upon the ground,   Then cupped the startled stranger’s face, to make   Thanks flesh: dry palms on cheeks, a silent sound.   He raised the weathered hand, pressed lips, devout,   To knuckles pale. A benediction brief.   “Thank you.” The English words, a fragile shout   Against the vast indifference of grief.   He gathered up the promise-weights anew,   Turned homeward, heart a bird despite the load.    A thump. A sting. A hiss. The grey plume grew,   Thick serpent coiling on the aid-strewn road.   Confusion’s fist clenched tight. A gasp, a cry.   He ran. Pure instinct, legs like splintered reeds   Propelled by terror’s lash beneath the sky.   Then came the sound- the harvest of grim seeds-   Sharp cracks that split the air, that hunted men.   Don’t look. Just run. Just run. His mantra beat.   But sudden force, a searing then,   Drove breath and balance from his stumbling feet.    He fell. The parcels flew. A crate-edge tore   The lentil sack. Small stones of hope burst free,   A scatter-pattern on the dusty floor.   The flour sack landed, spilling partially.   He clawed the grit. Get up! Retrieve! Command   Issued, ignored. His limbs were foreign clay.   He dragged an arm, a wounded crab on land,   Toward the lentils lost beside the way.    That’s when he saw the river, swift and bright,   Crimson and urgent, flowing from his core.   His own life’s tide, relentless in its flight,   Overtook lentils spilled upon the floor.   It swirled around them, stained them, deep and rich,   A grotesque irrigation, warm and fast.   Pain bloomed, immense. The world began to pitch,   A warmth that promised it would be the last.    Tears blurred. He blinked, one monumental strain.   Saw clearly: lentils drowned in vibrant red.   The sun beat down. He whispered through the pain,   ""Sorry, Yamma… Ukhti… I found… the bread.   I rest… but... just for… a little while…"" The light   Flickered. The promise-weight dissolved in red   The flour ghosted pale in fading sight.

The Northern Invasion of 2025,Acceptable_Link_6546,"#   Flocks of feathered fiends,   from the frozen land of maple trees,   the geese around my house   were enscripted for a mission.      Canada's waddling spies,   beaks sharp, all full of teeth,   black eyes glinting cold,   and honks that stop me dead.      The first wave of the Northern Invasion   has landed --   a minefield of poop across my lawn.      Now, Trump's been wrong about everything before--   but he says, ""This is it, boys, this is war!""   We have to fight back Canada.      And goddamn it, this time, I actually agree.      He's full of shit on several fronts:   on tariffs making us all rich,   our allies freeloading,   and climate change being   nothing but a democratic hoax.      Windmills don't cause cancer,   his crowd size was smaller than his dick,   our immigrant friends aren't eating our dogs   and Covid didn't magically disappear.      He's not quite the stable genius   that he claims he is --   but the geese? Yes, the geese!   I hate myself for saying it,   but a broken clock   is right twice a day.      So, grab your helmets, boys   your hazmat suits   and pooper scoopers--      Canada will rue the goddamn day   Trudeau sent geese to occupy us.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  1.

To the Girl Behind the Pharmacy Counter,CulturingPoems,"# [To the Girl Behind the Pharmacy Counter](https://poems.culturing.net/2023/12/to-the-girl-behind-the-pharmacy-counter/)  *18 December 2023*  You with the smile, asking favors with eyes only,   yes, I remember you too. But this is not the time   for a dance or the courting of pairs. You have asked me   to take my time, and I shall, as I linger over   what time has brought me. Not the east, or the sun,   but just you, with all faults still at this moment concealed.   Shall we remember fondly this meeting when hours of argument   wrangle our spirits, or when we find habits distasteful   which each of us cannot change? Yes, we shall, with disdain,   for it's always the same, as the first blush transforms   to the flush of rage, for we puppets on Nature's marionette.   You can bet it will happen again, as it's happened before,   even here, and to us, as we each go our ways   through the spasms of time. But this is not the time for a lesson, either,   when those eyes ask questions no poet could describe.   So here is my answer. I cannot divulge all my purposes   nor share with fellow traveller the path I have chosen.   So adieu, night-wanderer. May you find a home   and a love worth your while.

i only miss you when i'm high,ghostpoett,"**TW: Emotional manipulation / substance use**    when I get high,   I start mourning people who aren’t even dead.   start wondering if I was too quick to leave,   like the pain they gave me   was just my fault for bruising too easily—   like I imagined the whole thing   and bled from a wound that wasn’t real.  when I get high,   I start rehearsing apologies   for things I didn’t do,   convincing myself I was the problem   just so someone else doesn’t have to be—   like if I rewrite the story gentle enough,   maybe the ache will start to disappear.  when I get high,   I forget why I walked away.   I remember softness, not silence.   a few good moments blur   the weight of all the bad.   my brain starts stitching a new version of the past   with only the scenes that looked like love—   skipping the ones that drained me.  when I get high,   I start holding space   for versions of them that never even existed.   the “what if they changed” version.   the “maybe they meant well” version.   the ones I made up in the quiet   just to feel less alone.  when I get high,   I start thinking maybe I could handle it now—   the silence, the distance,   the slow unraveling of myself.   like maybe I’m stronger this time,   but all I’d be doing   is stepping back into the fire   just to prove I don’t burn the same.  when I get high,   I convince myself I’m healed enough to return—   not because I am,   but because I miss the hurt   more than I like the silence it left behind.  feedback link:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ro2u/comment/n4fz6z6/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ro2u/comment/n4fz6z6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mabqlu/comment/n5dhr65/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mabqlu/comment/n5dhr65/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

“I Didn’t Say Goodbye Right”,Poetic_wanderer,"I left like a whisper, not a storm, No slamming doors, no final form. I just faded slow, unseen, A ghost between the might-have-beens.  You didn’t ask, and I didn’t explain, Just nodded through the growing pain. I laughed at jokes I didn’t feel, And smiled like silence was a deal.  We talked, but only on the skin You didn’t know the war within. And maybe that’s the cruelest part You never saw me fall apart.  I won’t write a bitter verse, I won’t wish you pain or curse. But late at night, when truths replay, I ache for things I didn’t say.  Not that I loved you though I did. Not that I tried though that’s well hid. Just this: I left with quiet eyes, Because loud goodbyes feel too much like lies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/r9iIKsoFuU https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/F33MwQ5S5l"
Why to Love?,Rhaegal6,"Why to love:  Why shall our paths get entwined? when not our hands do?  Why am I to endure the burden of love that I not can have?  Why to love; O to be buried?        Why shall you possess the virtuous love; when it shall not be given;  To the other virtuous soul of mine; but to the soul of him framed of vigour shell.  Why do I stand beside the tree: Framed of vigour shell;  Whist you the sunshine shall glow on I and my children that shall resemble your eyes.        Are you the passing cloud; thus I shall be to blame;  To Exist, to be still beside you, to admire you.  Why are you not Moon; Shining on I for ever;  Thus let me gleam, let me live with your love.

Likewise, I don't want arrest my feelings, and I cannot. i want to set it free, i want to share this with my friends. But I cannot, Don't ask me why. So I don’t know what to do, but to write poems.

Save!,RobertaELee," Save!  Others play at checkers— He is playing chess. While teammates rotate off the ice, For him, there is no rest.  Between the pipes, within the crease, This little patch, his station. One hole, two hole—Butterfly! Not a nanosecond’s vacation.  The other five stay on alive As goals stack up relentless. Despite their fails, behind the rails, His worth is judged—resentless.  To face and chest, he takes each shot— Another harsh rendition. That vulcanized, relentless puck A tool of de-dentition.  Oh, one can be a hero, Or one can be a goat. There is no middle ground, you see— Just plastic on the throat.  His body bears the crushing weight Of pounds of padded gear. And through each brutal period waits To fend off charging fear.  So make the choice, and save your voice— No scorer, goon, or knave Can match the dopamine that floods When the rafters erupt with: “Save!”    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/jpnQyE8oTz  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/0foltc0AIa"

But you made it clear When you walked out the door That you no longer felt the same.   You said feelings change; Things change It’s time we moved on. These words,   they cut like a knife.    I wrap my arms around me, To shield me from the cold. As I sit here and watch, The smoke burns out of yet another cigarette in the ashtray.    Wish I could forget you.  I want to forget you.  To move on.  Yet, I remember every line.  Every touch of your face.  Every smile.  Every kiss.    Your memory fills my heart.  Like a jukebox in the dark.  Each memory a coin in the jukebox.  Each memory a dagger thru my heart.  I’ll move on.  I’ll get over you.  I know I will.

Softness Without Disappearing,theliminalfox,"*(Her POV)*  The air was heavy that morning.   The sun shined too bright.   Birds too loud   for the storm cloud   I was carrying.  You poured the tea.   I didn’t say thank you    not because I forgot,   but because you already knew.  The house wasn’t quiet.   It was held.   Softly padded with intention.   Mug to coaster.   Light left dim.   Curtains drawn, but not closed.  My socks didn’t match.   I hadn’t eaten.   I was all edges    skin too loud,   bones too tired to arrange.  You brought me fruit.   Cut small. No skin.   The kind I didn’t have to chew with guilt.  You didn’t ask what was wrong.   You didn’t have to.  We folded laundry   without speaking.   You gave my favourite plush his seat back   after I’d dropped him   on a bad day   and walked away    oblivious, numb.  And when I cried    not loudly,   not beautifully    but the kind of crying   that tucks itself in a corner   and doesn’t dare ask to be seen   You didn’t flinch.   You just sorted socks.   You wiped the bench again.   You stayed in the room   and made it bigger.  You stayed.   So I did too.  And in that silence,   I remembered softness   doesn’t have to vanish   to be safe.  ---  **The Way She Stayed**   *(His POV)*  I didn’t ask what was wrong.   It’s not because I didn’t care.  I knew.   I saw it.  The mug wasn’t where she usually left it.   Her favourite plush was missing from the couch.   She didn’t hum when the kettle boiled.  Something had left the air.  So I made the tea.   The good one.   The one she saved for “after.”  I sliced the apple   the way she liked   but never asked for    wedged, peeled, soft.  I didn’t ask, “Are you okay?”   Because she wasn’t.   And that wasn’t the point.  I just moved gently.   Sat nearby.   Sorted socks into familiar pairs.   Cleared the crumbs from the bench.   Touched nothing that asked to be left alone.  I let her silence bloom.   I didn’t pluck it.   I didn’t fill it with kindness meant for me.  And when she cried    not the kind that begs for arms,   but the kind that hopes not to be seen   I stayed.  I didn’t rescue.   I didn’t vanish.   I didn’t explain the quiet away.  And maybe   she didn’t say thank you.  But she didn’t leave either.  And that’s when I knew:   she still trusted the room   we made together.   Still let it hold her,   without asking it to heal her.  And that, I think    is how softness survives.  ---  **✦ Author’s Note: The Echo Psalms ✦**  *The Echo Psalms* are written as paired reflections.   Two voices, one moment.

Pressure,DaveJDash,"Hey, how's it going?   Looks like you've been doing well.   Thought I'd check in.   Did you forget what you promised?   Those things you said you'd do?   I know you're having a good time,   Making progress,   Growing, making strides, all that.   Just thought I'd remind you.      It's time to put your head down and work.   The others are waiting for you.   Sure, take care of yourself.   Just — just don't forget about your obligations.   You're important.   They're counting on you.      I know, I know,   It's been so long since you've relaxed,   Since you've stopped working,   Taken a break,   Had some leisure,   You know what I mean.   There's not that much left to do.      At least, not before you need to get back to work.   Or make more money.   Or help somebody else.   But what's all that,   When you're doing it for those you love?   The sacrifice is worth it.   It's not that much, really.      Good, good,   You've got some time to recharge.   Take that time.   Just not too much time.   Don't get me wrong,   It's good for you to have it.   But they need you more.   Get back out there as soon as you can.      What?   You don't have the energy?   Well, that's disappointing.   You really can't muster it?   You probably can,   If you try.   Try harder.   Just a matter of effort and availability.      Don't worry about the toll.   The time will come for you.   When?   That's asking the wrong question.   That's not what this is about.   Anyway, you might feel a bit zapped.   That's not important.   You can still be present,   Do it all,   Get the job done,   All things to all people.      What you perceive,   The others noticing your fatigue,   Your dejection,   Your irritability,   Your turmoil,   I see it.   It's no small thing.   But it's not time for that.   Push through, respond,   Be there for them.   That's all.      Trust me,   You're good enough now,   With the desires left hanging,   The body left unfed,   The mind stretched,   The transcendent impulses quieted.   That's all they need.   Just you.   Well — you where you are now.   Not you at your best.   It's not that important.   It can wait.      There will be time,   There will be time,   There will be time.   It'll come.   Remember your obligations,   Be there.   Respond.   React.   Keep your cup empty.   Fill it later.   Later — you understand.   It'll come.      When?   I — I don't need to answer that.

Ode to the Left Guard,RobertaELee,"  Ode to the Left Guard  In a line filled with ogres, He is still the smallest. Six-three, two-ninety-five, But not close to the tallest.  No outside-the-pocket glory; No audibles to call. Just relentless double-teams, Pulling ahead of the ball.  The stats for him are vague, but Without him: all punts. And when comes fourth and inches, His battered body, it hunts!  Whether trap, sweep, or pass protect, His quick feet always there. His massive paws and forearms— To the backer-brutes, he dares.  Another three or six through drives Again goes on the board. The wide-out spikes in triumph;  And dances once it’s scored.  But where is he?  In trenches deep and dire, Caked in filth and caustic mud. From cheek, arm, and busted limb Drip rivers of crimson blood.  He is tradesman, soldier, all at once; But what beneath each layer? A Brobdingnagian presence, yes— But fierce heart and soul. True player.  Line life is never easy; ‘tis Violent, fast, and hard. And so it goes for anyone Who suits up at left guard.  And years later, knees shattered And brain much worse for wear. Movement itself? Hard labor; A wrenching cross to bear.  But any life worth living Measures in inches, downs, and yards. And so it goes for anyone Who suits up at left guard.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/jnW6G8g6c1   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/IF1vZ6nwS0"

I’m unsure about my poetry need feedback also recommend titles.,TechnicianIcy8163," I love smiles. I love synchronicity. I love my bunny teeth, and I love being a child with children. I love ocean waves and purple hues on my hands. I love ghosts on bridges and rivers that run on and on. But I also love rivers when they stop and condense into stillness. I love hide and seek, but I hate seeking and being found. I love excitement— but also, numb tranquility.  I love hedonism, but they tell me to love rationality. Rationality is peace, and I love that— but peace prevents dreams, and I hate that. Well… isn’t it like poetry? Some say it should be complex. Some prefer simplicity. Cant it just be poetry? When love loves to love love, the vertigo is insanity? And if falling is freedom— then I would.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/8yWW69g7Nq  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/KyEffABXrn"

Beneath Her Skin / The Wyrm Within,TiredGiant,"It’s writhing deep beneath her skin,  A wretched thing she strains to hide.  I need to know what lies within.  ‎   A forkéd tongue behind her grin,  Devours all I dare confide.  It’s writhing deep beneath her skin.   ‎   And soon the beast’s beneath *my* skin,  It’s clawed and gnawed through all my hide.  I need to know what lies within.  ‎   Her mint mirage is paper thin,  She’s tried to leave the wyrm behind.  It’s writhing deep beneath her skin.   ‎   Despite her prayer and desperate hymn,  The creature’s now inside her eyes.  I need to know what lies within.  ‎   It’s bound to overflow her brim,  Dread……   what hideous thing will I find?  It’s writhing deep beneath her skin,  I need to know what lies within.

Some Loves don't make a sound!,Poetic_wanderer,"We didn’t meet like movies show, No sparks flew high, no skies aglow. It started slow just eyes that stayed, A quiet smile that never swayed.  No perfect lines, no scripted part, Just late-night talks and open heart. You learned my silence, I your fears, We stitched our past with patient years.  You saw the mess behind my charm, Still held my shaking hand with calm. No pedestal, no worship throne Just two cracked souls who made a home.  We fought like hell, we laughed like fire, We lost the script, we climbed up higher. Through storm and still, through wrong and right, You were the war and still the light.  You weren’t the dream I used to chase, But real as rain upon my face. Not perfect, no, but damn sincere You stayed when love meant facing fear.  So no, this isn’t fairy-tale bound, Some loves don’t fly, they root the ground. And if they ask what love looks like  I'll point to us, through dark and bright.   ""Not every love story is loud. Some are quiet. Real. And unforgettable. Wrote this from the heart-what do you think?"" https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/F33MwQ5S5l https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/r9iIKsoFuU"

Before I Knew Not to Hope,Vibes-And-Vinegar,"You were twelve.   I was nine.   Too small to matter,   too close not to.    We wrestled on the living room carpet    like kids who hadn’t learned    what not to touch.   You let me win,   sometimes.   Or maybe I was stronger than you thought.    Your laugh:   always louder than mine,   always unafraid.     In your room with schoolwork spread between us,   you’d scribble answers,   tap your pen against your lip,   then draw stars on my wrist    without thinking.   Over fractions, then physics, then years    that didn’t feel like years.     Little constellations    between bone and skin.   Like celestial maps I never read right.    No asking.   No reason.   Like it meant nothing.    Which, I guess, it did.      But I kept still.   Like maybe if I didn’t move,   you’d keep drawing.    You kissed me once.   A joke we both pretended was funny.   Truth or dare.    Your breath smelled like root beer    and I pretended    my heart didn’t do anything strange.    You were always going to outgrow me.   I knew.   Even then.    The girls your age wore mascara    and laughed     quieter.   I had skinned knees    and pencil smudges on my hands.    And five years later,   you said my name like it didn’t mean anything.   Like the stars never stained your fingers.   Like I’d never sat beside you    pretending I didn’t already know    how it would end.    Still,   sometimes,   I trace that spot on my wrist.   And not because of the stars.    Because you never looked    when you stopped drawing them.      https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/XDk7AAo1Zv  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/2Br6q3qY7e"
Love Me- A chronic illness poem,Marforstars,"  One day I’ll be trapped in this body. My hands will be curled in, my spine unbreakable bent into unnatural curls that matches the curl of my ebony hair with only the slightest sliver of gray. Feet bowed and tight bound to the silver throne wheeled by bed maids. Tortured day in and out, a morphine drip drip dripping into my chest soothing a body that once dreamt of more.  Of more. Of more.   A body once swept away with the count of 8, now follows the pallid drip of morphine slowly dripping away the mind that dreamt of more.   I hope, when I reach this point someone will kill me. Give me grace and mercy. Let my tense muscles relax for the first time in decades. Let my spine unfurl like a butterflies cocoon. Release me into the light and the rainbows and the people who love me. Love me. Love me. Kill me. Please.    When my brain drifts away into a silver dream, where roses are sunflowers, do not let me be.  Love me.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NJ4Pk3Oz41  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/86zp7WTts6"

You're aware that while haughty eyes set your earthly vessel ablaze, they shield your empyrean spirit from his destructive gaze. You receive that while his shallow desires bring traumas anew, he was all too shortsighted to see the very best part of you.

Repeatedly…..  Why does your searing pain clear my mind so,  And show me who is friend and who is foe  Oh, what a fool I am  To converse with you once again    Behold! Passion the great beast of Rome,  With Mane Of fire and tusk of the puriest stone  May you guide my spirit through life's great poem  Oh what a fool I am  To matador with you once again    Kings and Queens gather round,  And listen to the fool who bears the false crown  For I shall tell it to your face  The path you walk ends in last place    Be damned upon the cross of your golden intentions  Or speak to your gods of true actions,  For the time of madness is upon us  And all of you are weak and utterly groundless      **The Duty to the Forest!**  THE FOREST ARE EMPTY!

So those who forget listen to me!    Your first duty is to the divine whatever that might be,  Know, while you may be a question, never the answer key,  And no matter how fast you run, one day you too shall leave    Your second duty is to the wisdom to set your brother free,  For knowledge is how we become the oak tree,  To shelter those who find themselves weak!    Your third duty is to the earth, wind, and sea,  For the world is on fire and the soil can no longer cultivate seed  For we must war against the demon we know as greed,  Men who are blinded by the lure of freedom,  Do not forget your duty three-     **The lie**  LIES IN THE COURTROOM  LIES IN THE HALL  LIES IN THE CHURCH, CASTLE AND BALL.  They have stolen from our mother and given to your lord,  The title of creator is not his to horde!   Tell me of a man who has birthed another,  A job only a goddess can ever endeavor!

The Cliff,ShootnSugar," As I stand upon the ever-shifting precipice of self  And wonder in my turmoil if I’m truly someone else  If I uphold the values that I claim to emulate  And how my contribution to the world will change its shape   I begin to paint two pictures: one of guilt and seeking blame  But the other is of hope for something greater to my name  One might argue that is prideful and defeative of the purpose  But I see, that pride when humble, might be deemed as righteous   Society is shifting but mentality stays true  And with it comes a contradiction battling the new  We have tried to put a focus on the unity we crave  And yet it’s been opposed in the most trivial of ways   We look to passion for ambition and new ways to educate  We’re moving towards a new definition “healthy state”  Yet denial can be powerful and indeed so can be fear  So its true sometimes the negative is easier to hear   I see the change that could be looming to some, who still don’t understand  I see the hate from those who were raised before the tides had shifted sands  Though I can’t see the bottom now and how exactly we got down  I argue I can teach someone to climb up again, somehow   To be the kind of person who will dive down from the edge  Through the murkiest of waters, to begin the dreaded dredge  To wade with open ears and an empathetic heart  But also to take stands against the wrong and do my part   Helping all of us move forward, no matter time or effort for this world  But then dawns upon me, I am small and still and girl  The task, it seems so daunting it overwhelms me as I ponder  And, yet I still persist as my thoughts still seem to wonder   Can I make a difference in a way that is impactful?  Do I have the strength to carry on and still be grateful?  How do I contain myself when I am growing weary?  And will I just continue in pursuit of some found glory?   Does it start to taint my actions; cause though I’m focused on the better  It’s, so I can live there too in a place that suits my pleasure?  Or is anxiety my master in this moment realize  I have the skills and will to take on anything with clear eyes.   The eyes that try to understand an already blurry mess  So my day to day might make a change if I attempt to do my best  I’ll come up for air when needed and I’ll take breaks along the shore  I’ll have others there like-minded, to drag me out when I am sore   For my mother taught me something to this day I’ve not forgot  She said, “Nothing’s without reason dear and nothing is for naught.”  So if, even in a lifetime, the colour only turns a shade  It will be a little brighter in the world here, I have made   And I argue that is something to devote a lifetime to  Regardless of the darkness and the muck, you’re wading through   (Thank you for any and all feedback all first time poster here.

"Live By The Sword, Die By Words",ExaminationOwn3456,"Live by the sword, die by words.  It’s a pain that transcends the feeling of being stabbed. It’s a fear created by a distant dad. It’s a pain that hurts worse than death— a death that comes only when you seek rest.  You feel the metal beneath your skin, but it’s the kind of battle only one person can win.  I live by the sword, fighting battles in my head every day just to feel a little bit more okay.  I feel the cuts, the stabs, the gashes— but still, it’s me that my mind lashes.  I lived by the sword, and now I die by words-  the ones that tear open my soul, taking out the parts of me I used to know.  Empty promises, meant to make you think more positive. Empty words that seal your view, that refuse to acknowledge what I’ve been through.  “You’re doing well.” I don’t hear that a lot. But even when I do, it still feels like hell.  It’s like a messed-up crossword puzzle where every clue is a question about my own self-worth.  I wish it was fire. I could walk through it and just be burned.  Maybe then they’d notice. Maybe then it wouldn’t just be the rocks of my mind left unturned.   Comments:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/B8oDoCUIPR  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/PGRhYar8BK"
The Math Of My Self Hate,ExaminationOwn3456," I hope that one day I’ll be able to count my reasons to live as well as I count my calories.  That one day I won’t be afraid of seeing numbers on a scale. For when I see them rise, My face goes pale, And I feel like I fail.  When my weight goes up, My worth goes down, And I feel like a clown Trapped in a house of mirrors.  But I hope this one is faulty, For I can’t see what there is to like. My proportions far off, I wished this one would shatter— That the number on a scale and in my head wouldn’t matter.  I want to eat a meal without guilt, To live in a world without the numbers. For when I see them, I wilt.  I’m a flower bending under its own weight, The stem—its body— That it’s come to hate.  It knows it’s still growing, But its weight is showing. So off comes a leaf, Off goes my belief.  There is not much room left in this mind of mine. I’m tired of pretending like I think my body’s fine. I think it’s crossed a line.  As my numbers rise higher, It’s more and more self-hate I learn to acquire.  Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/bvTpNsQBFD  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/fMb4wObxwX"
My Home,sealen41,"*How did this make you feel? Does if flow well? What could be better? What isn’t working?

At the end of their ropes,   Marriage falling apart, betrayed,   Children ripped from their arms—   Thats how we help them! Be strong.     Well, let me tell you: Empathy dont do shit.   How about justice, or answers, or fairness?   How about real solutions   To this common convolution?     It isn’t the man.   It isn’t the woman.   It’s two people.   Two choices.     Two lives, bent by desire    To share the skin of another person   That’s forbidden. And once touched   Destroys all within a home.     My home.     I cannot leave.   I cannot stay.

Dreams are uncertain—   Will I ever heal?   Existing in a chamber   Pot that’s completely sealed.     Even telling you this, I fear discovery.   What if she sees?   It’ll hurt her like they hurt me.   But I dont want to be   That person.     Trapped.     Thats the person I am.   Thats what I’ve earned by being a man   Who cares deeply   About others’ feelings   All the while shielding   Himself from his own.

None of my poems are worthy of a title,Green_Event5141,"Between the scarlett skies and shadowed earth, I stand, fractured — a man caught in the seam.  Love and despair are twin serpents, coiled deep in my ribcage, whispering promises and curses alike.  I reached for grace — in her, I thought I found it, that fragile flame that could warm the frozen parts, the shattered parts, the parts no one ever asked to see.  She was the siren — the voice both angelic and cruel, singing songs I longed to believe, only to leave me shipwrecked on jagged rocks.  I wore a mask — hand-carved and heavy, built from twisted faith, a mosaic of prayers and hardened vows. It was my fortress, my tomb, the shape of survival.  But beneath that mask, my heart bled starry red — hooked on false hopes, betrayed again by the very thing that sought love.  I tried to fold into her world, play the fool, the jester, lay down arms I never truly held.  And when she left, I carved a wall of fire, swore never again to bleed for anyone but God, whose eyes never faltered, whose hands never crushed.  Yet, in the dark, the shadows creep — fingers of doubt, rage, and twisted faith, whispering the truth I don’t want to hear: I am alone here, walking cursed earth beneath a sky heavy with blood and promise.  No evangelist, no preacher — only a man with prayers woven tight, holding fast to a faith that bends but does not break.  I walk through this masquerade, an actor in a never-ending play, changing faces, mask hardening like stone.  But beneath it all, there is a quiet tenacity — a drug, a numbness, a hope that maybe, just maybe, there is a chance —  A chance with condition, a chance with betrayal, a chance with death — but a chance nonetheless.  Between the scarlett and the shadows, I find my truth:  Not perfect, not whole, but enough. A fractured soul, wearing my mask, bearing my wounds, walking forward into a world that never promised mercy —  But where I still hold God’s light, scarlett as dawn, sharp as blood, steadfast as the stars.

Drunkard’s Progress,pucktherat,"For a while you sat at step #2 -  A glass to keep the cold out. Now you’re leaning against the wall, falling off the eighth step unconscious and dropping drool into my eyes  and the beer is always flat. After you staggered down the avenue all night I ate the candy bar stashed below the stoop for breakfast And let it crawl into the space in my stomach.  The sixteen maggots burrowing inside me Enjoy squirming here better than staying in the chocolate. They fester in the lining and our friends keep sticking matches Down my throat to try to smoke them out. “All I want is some sort of grace” with my hands up to god But I don’t remember what I’m talking about So you break your bottle over my skull to get me thinking straight  Before you slip your tongue through the new gaps in our teeth To kiss me rotten while I wrap you in newspapers.  They smell foul and they say that we’re dying but I do it To protect you from the weather so I can tell you that I hope you don’t survive the sunrise. You plug up my nosebleed and I butt  my head into your face to settle the score.  You wrap the 40 around our hands with gauze  and you tell me you host the maggots, too.  The stomach squirms for a reason  And the infested organs pull us down towards the foot of the stairs  where everything is still and everything is hell. You dust the bits of broken glass out of my hair  And stick them under my fingernails so I can dig six feet down. There’s a dark brown shard lodged at the nape of my neck  so I pull it out and hold it up to the light And it looks golden when the sun streams through it Like cathedral glass or a beer bottle or cathedral glass. I slide it into the slit of your belly button and ask you if you feel it. It’s Mother Mary’s hair  It’s the dirt and the straw It’s the shards of your dinner Flat and stale It’s Mother Mary’s hair!  It’s the dirt and the straw!  I’m feeding the maggots in your stomach And you’re feeding the ones in mine.   Google “the drunkards progress” for the reference image - an old prohibition era cartoon  F1:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mcejst/the_final_hymn/n5w1v8q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3  F2:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/l0dQnWQGRz  phone glitching and won’t let me put in the link nicely sorry lol"

"“Because It Was Itchy, I Stopped.“",loceapeace,"  The milk I sipped that morning still clung to the roof of my mouth. The bus never came. At the fold of the afternoon, a cloth that failed to speak sneered. A death with no reply. Who first mouthed its rhyme? A bent sound remained unpasted. The emptied shelf repeated voices from long ago.  　  A face tagged with sweetness traced the air with fingers that hadn’t fully cooled, as if reusing yesterday’s heat. The face that refused its turn preserved its silence inside the screen. Tongueless customers stood in line, pretending to know they were standing in for someone else.  　  What had been seared into the skin was the correctness called “It couldn’t be helped.” Beneath the mumbling, a shadow that kept refusing proof was rotting. Breaths were left in the aisles, and a joke that hadn’t yet been thrown away was quietly swelling. A voice, half-stitched, was scraping.  　  “I knew it was lying there. My shoe only made a sound when I stepped on it.”  I turned back, just a little. But when I reached to pick it up, my finger itched—so I stopped. I never wondered whose sound it had been.  “The moment we pointed and laughed, he collapsed. But no one had actually looked at the pointing finger.”  　  Because no one had killed, it was arranged. There were enough chairs, but no one sat. The shoes that were scheduled to die before noon were still walking. What sank there was a weight untouched by any hand.  　  The one who was waiting—was me. Before it could reach anyone’s mouth, the sound had already dried up. “This is unrelated,” said a scraped voice, and then I fell silent. I had really just been asleep. And the moment I thought that excuse would do, what remained wasn’t a name— but a weight.    ---    “Because It Was Itchy, I Stopped.“｜Interpretive Poem   　  What went unpicked wasn’t guilt— but the blur in the urge to touch it. “It was itchy” is not forgiveness. It’s merely the one refusal the speaker was allowed to make.  　  This poem is a caricature of inaction, where systems and ethics settle into the backs of those who “did nothing.”  　  The joke was never discarded. Laughter only swelled atop someone’s corpse. The true culprit wasn’t malice but indifference. And no one tried to prove it. (That, too, was the system’s job.)  　  The shoes kept walking. Only the time scheduled for death survived. No one took responsibility, yet the weight was undeniably there.  　  So perhaps, the true subject of this poem is not “I” but “the silence of someone who didn’t laugh.”  　  The tsuchinoko is long gone. But a society that never stumbles over its absence— can it really claim to be unrelated?  　  To ask that, a finger that merely itched might not have been enough.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "
The Pixie and the DO,laricifus,"It waits alone in a cage built for two,   It sunders and wonders what pain means to you.   She waits in slumber, knowing pain is her truth,   And the darkness comes knocking   Knock knocking a tooth.    It keeps going to find what it can,   And finds its own sadness is only what’s left.   It leans down to give the pixie a kiss   And with darkness she grows until the knight is unblessed.   The thing goes knocking, knock knocking— with haste   And the pain the knight once knew becomes haunting again.   He knows not what to do, but let the knocking begin.    I once knew a song to chivalry be true,   But now everything is wrong, and daunting in truth   I try so hard, but the hate runs deep,   And nothing, nothing can save them from me.   I knows how to knock   Knock knocking a tooth,   And the anger I harbor is known to but one.   So how can my forgiveness ever be won.    I imagine again and see the pixie’s fine hair,   Her wings and her eyes, bring me out of despair.   My armor returns and the thing dissipates,   It comes back for a taste and I swing with great haste.   It lunges forward with a lumbering slash,   Shattering my shield with a thunderous clash.   The Darkness is winning and armor is peeled   So I reach up In anger as love spreads its mouth   And I bite that darkness right on the tooth.    The knight is overcome with feelings of surrender,   But a calm light radiates from within the darkness's place   and all becomes clear to the knight what's in front of his face.   It is neither here nor there, not he nor I,   But something cold that remains mingled in all our souls.   Something old that we must all learn to hold.   The darkness tries to take him in suit,   But he does not buckle for he know his truth.   Nothing, oh nothing, will come knock knocking his tooth.    The darkness is banished and   The two embrace in their cage.   But they both will remember,   That the darkness has a place   Outside of their page.   With locks of feather and   Skin of oil, the Old One   Will send her willingness again.   It knows but one truth   And that is it's name.   The Dark One comes knocking,   Knock knocking again.   You’ll let it keep knocking   If you let it in,   But eat it you must   To let love in again.    The knight and pixie together at last,   Go knocking, knock knocking on the pearly   Black gates.    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is the first part in a series of poems I'm working on, would be great to get some feedback and see if there is any interest in seeing the rest.

The Ritual In-Between,zyerhod1,"**The Ritual In-Between**   *by Bryon Slack*  They came in hush.   Shifting beings   whose forms blurred   at the edges,   lingering between   shadow and mist   until Her gaze   called them still.  They carried silence   in open hands,   tongues wound   in ribbons of perhaps,   eyes reflecting ache   they would not name.  Their offerings   spilled like memory—   uncontained,   but never   quite enough   to stain the stone.  Their verses curled   like smoke,   and vanished   as courage often does   when met with flame   before the words   can name the author.  But She does not eat mist.      Truth stands bare—   unhooded, unblinking,   Her silence louder   than any empty   word shaped like flowers   with no teeth.  She does not reach   for the presented mirrors,   their edges beveled and   faces smoked to make   Her words cut less deeply.  Songs that wrapped Her   harshness in velvet softness   came discordant from   quivering, timid throats   causing dark clouds   to pass over Her   countenance.  Each failed supplicant   of shadow and dream fell away   from Her like morning   mist before the dawn   as I stepped forward.  My head bowed in shame,   I admitted my failings   in low, sure tones.   I spoke of allowing   the sight She had given   me to be colored   by Desire and Truth's   own despised sister,   Hypocrisy.  My raiments dropped around   me and I stood ready   to accept Her Judgement,   bare and unmasked.   Her hand reached out beneath   my chin until my gaze locked   with Hers.  Smiling eyes and smirking   lips met my vision before   She drew me to Her.  **Feedback given:**   [""The Guilt of Never Being Enough""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mckctm/comment/n5vd5rd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""The Postman Time Forgot""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mcmxif/comment/n5vc81m/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Soooo handsome,arb271,"I am so tired of handsome.  I have spent hours and hours, looking at, looking up ‘handsome’.  I look at handsome, and handsome is also looking at handsome.

I should know, I have done my fair share of farming for it.  But it’s just a sugar crop, nothing to live off of,  only grown to mask bitter, earth flavors.  It is worthless on its own and it rots the teeth out of my head; ***me,*** toiling, bent over for handsome,  my stomach in knots, sick and bloated on handsome.  \-  Great, now I’m diabetic. But hey, at least the culprit was handsome.  No, just wait till you see him, he’s soooo handsome.  I’ve asked the world, the people and the worms, and they said  he’s handsome.  —————  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7vmRftZsVr](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7vmRftZsVr)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/3Iu7gTfHJ7](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/3Iu7gTfHJ7)"

The postman time forgot,Due-Presentation3959,"The Postman Time Forgot  Narrator: The Postman (a cursed figure who reads undelivered love letters) Observing figures: Time (silent), the Poet (absent), the Muse (never replied)    They never told me letters could bleed, That envelopes weep what the mouths don't plead. They handed me grief in ribbon and lace, Stamped with hope, and sealed in disgrace.  I was the keeper of truths unsent, Of sighs wrapped in sweet intent. But now I open them, one by one, And read what’s left when love is done.  The ink is cracked, the lines decay, But I feel each word like a knife in clay. Not paper no this is skin once kissed, And every letter is a pulse I missed.  He wrote of stars she’d never see, Of nights that begged her memory. He loved her in ways no god could bless, With hands that shook beneath his chest.  But she was silence, clothed in form, A name that danced but kept no warm. The letters pile like autumn’s regret, Unread, unclaimed, unanswer’d yet.  They say I’m just a courier ghost, But I carry what you fear the most Not death, not fire, but love misplaced, A prayer to a god who erased her face.  I read his lines through tears he drank, “I’d trade the sun just to feel you thank Me for a love that asked for none, Only a glance before I’m gone.”  But gone he is the poet’s dust, Drowned in ink, betrayed by trust. No farewell kiss, no final sign, Just pages torn by phantom time.  Some poems rot before they’re read, Some lovers die before they’re dead. And I the bearer of breathless pleas Am cursed to kneel with trembling knees.  For every letter speaks to me, Not to the one they wished would see. And still I walk, through rain and ruin, Through towns where dreams forget their tune.  I knock on doors no hands unlatch, I slip through cracks, no hearts attach. They burned the writer, lost the song, Yet left me with the notes so wrong.  I carry verses no one keeps, Of poets drowned in unsent weeps. She never knew what she inspired And now his bones are cold, retired.  She wasn’t the reason I was the ruin, She didn't love me; she left a lesson I cannot learn. He wrote those words before he broke, Before his candle died in smoke.  And Time just watched, like stars from shore, Too old to grieve, too tired to mourn. It whispered once, as winds will do, “Even I cannot undo what’s true.”  I folded back the final page, As dusk crept through the iron cage. And wept for him for every line, A funeral held in postal time.   The saddest letters are the ones delivered too late, and the saddest reader is the one who believed they still could wait.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hNXGcfIpTJ  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/gcWMrSpgct       "
Why Must I Be Someone First?,Maleficent_Mango_710,"I wonder,   will I ever find love   if I don’t become successful?  Why do I have to earn it—   this thing called love—   just because I’m a man?

Chess,Static_User_88,"  They call it a game of battle and tactics, but I think there's more to it. Perhaps rival kingdoms with two kings who were once best friends.  An indifference grew between them, their hatred burning to different degrees. Their friendship fell apart, and they crossed paths once again.  Looking for new territory, but no one truly claimed control. Each square a battleground, black and white, a never-ending cycle.  It never stopped, there was no conclusion. Maybe that's why kings can't touch, because their hatred runs so deep that eye-to-eye contact was never an option.  (I tried a very different style of poetry than usual for me but I think it turned out great any thoughts)  But I did write one in my usual style  Two Kings the greatest of friends  Started a battle that seems to never make ends Black and White, A battle never sought Just seems to continue being fought   Never had they touched  Only had they crouched  Because the hatred ran so deep  This fate was always seemed to be a big big leap  Many needed hope That these were friends again, tied to a rope  (Thanks for reading my poetry by the way I really appreciate it)  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/1rGquqnqRQ https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/sKkGlSa9El"

He who suffers.,ABadLookingSpy," He who suffers, never stopped laughing. He suffers so deeply, he had to invent laughter.   He never opened the floodgates. How could the river flow, when the past has left a dam blocking the current’s path?   People see him— they offer hollow advice. But when a man is drowning, that is no time to teach him how to swim.   They talk of self-respect. But how can one who is truly conscious ever wholly respect himself? To be human is to be confined by inadequacy.   He says nothing of his storming thoughts. He does not speak of his pain— for to reason with the ignorant is to become the fool yourself.   And how many times can a man like him die? Is it when the heart still beats, but no longer feels? Or when the eyes remain open, but see nothing left worth living for?   Perhaps pain changes nothing. Perhaps it only repeats— until the man forgets who he was before.

"I, who will be forever. Again.",star_child13,"# I, who will be forever. Again.  By Sumo. (Dylan NoLastName)  Why do you live such a finite existence?  The most widely accepted theory for the end of the universe is the heat death theory. Life is but a burning flame only so much kindling to go around.  But it will eventually burn out no matter what we do. After such a long time– honestly you wouldn’t get it even if I tried to explain– the darkness will snuff out the final spark of life. And entropy will take everything you love and then you. Everything is dust, meaningless to the sands of time.  But why?  Something doesn’t make sense… if everything is destined to return to nothing, consumed by the end… then why am I here writing this. Why are you there reading it?  If it is to be ripped apart then how is it possible for it to begin?  Atoms flinging across the vacuum of space, millions of years with not a single sign of another… thing. Just darkness.  But over infinity. It will exist in every possible part of the universe. Even if the universe expands forever it’s nothing to the power of time. It will forever exist in every possible place in the universe.  But if that’s so then how can it be possible that it doesn’t collide with a single other atom and jump start the universe?  Given time, an endless… basically unfathomable amount of time it will one day eventually collide with another and thus the darkness has failed once again. To its own machinations it can not stop the universe.  Unless everything is pulled apart perfectly and held there perfectly forever then it’s not possible for the universe to end. Because in infinity there is an infinite amount of tries to make existence once again.  Let me break it down for you like this:  Take an apple… and put it into an empty box that is completely endless in space. Eventually left alone long enough it will rot, decay and turn to dust. The make up of the apple will scatter to the darkness.  But given enough time again. Enough iterations over time…  It will form the exact same apple you put in, and I don’t mean a close imitation or a copy… I mean the EXACT same apple you put in the box so long ago.  Unless entropy reaches 100% absolute perfection and maintains that forever then it’s not possible for it to stop the rebirth of the universe.  So let me ask you again…Why do you live such a finite existence?  Or rather why do you think you live a finite existence?  When everything will one day die but will always be reborn then you are living right now, you will live again. Maybe next time you will have different hair, different skin, maybe you will have a different eye color… but it will be you… completely you. Not a copy, or a similarity but you exactly.   From the moment the universe was first born till infinity and then Again… you will exist. Again… and Again. Forever. You will laugh, you will cry, you will experience the highest possible moments of bliss and equally the lowest possible moments of despair.  You have forever so there is no point in rushing it. For you, who will be forever. Again.  \---  Side note: This has been sitting in my google docs for a while now so I thought I'd post it, it's meant to be prose poetry.

When The Trees Cried,TrainingNoise2403,"In a clearing amidst leaves a-rampant,   Where tangled, time-worn weeds are abundant.   There a village did stand.  The people there bore their joys on the trees,   Their elden ways and lore inscribed on leaves —   A merry folk indeed.  Their oaken homes encircled a willow,   Where spoken prayers drifted to and fro.   Yet to whom did they bow?  Far from the reaches of leaves — there it stood,   Their centerpiece, an Irminsul of wood.   The bough did smile — t’was good.  Mother nature never was eternal   And futile to believe it could so be.   As whispers beyond the shrubs,   Spoke of a dawn of fiery sea.  The village elders witnessed such visions,   Call to arms they did against tradition.   The Irminsul slowly glows dim.  Some pleaded for peace underneath the bough,   While some others struck steel to save their vow.   But their fates had always been sealed.  The eyes of the youth were soon struck with fear,   As their fathers raised fire so very near —   The birds took wing, and fled the day.  The village, now restless, spoke of the west,   A message of warning from gilded crests.   A fortnight they waited — in vain.  The village was soon to be outnumbered,   Their defiance doomed the forest’s slumber.   Men in mail and crests bore blades and flames.  From oak to oak, the flames did smother,   Pleas and dreams fell silent, ‘midst the terror.   No soul was spared by royal order.  The trees cried out as their branches crackled,   The wind turned grey over ruins it beheld.   The Irminsul smoldered — as visions foretold.  \-----------------------------------------------   1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mcenex/comment/n5tggwh/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button)   2 (https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mc2i6t/comment/n5thm00/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button)  Feedback pls!"
Two Sides of A Coin (Title In Work),AuthorOfEclipse,"The grand Creator of things all  Birthed the world and its void  A chasm so deep and dark  From which the Craftsman forged  A spark  Bursting with life.  The Grand Architect crafted man  From dust and stone  From land and water—  The Lifegiver breathed life.  But did the Artisan truly?  The Red King smiles a tempting smile,  He tells of things that Man is forbidden from.  Why?  Why not?  Man should have it all—  Man is, after all, made of the Divine Face.  Man commits a sin so grave  He lost Paradise's place.  He falls from grace  On a dusty bed  From which he was once bred.  Man looks around and feels  Shame.  Feels fear.  And feels  Hurt.  Did the Creator love him not?  Could Man not have been forgiven?  But Man has forgotten:  He was not owed anything.  He was born and formed  By the Divine Grace.  So he weeps and begs of times when  He knew not of things forbidden,  He knew only of The Divinity and  The Forgiving.  His companion sits beside him,  Takes his head on her knees.  She weeps too,  For the fault is equal of both.  Pity is taken, and blessings ensue.  Time passes.  Now Man's lineage rules land,  Dreams of going back to Paradise—  Whence from where they fell.  Such is pride.  They forget  They committed sin  Once before.  In the Red King's name,  Temptations start again.  If Man is of Divine Race,  Why is he not the one ruling the Divine Place?  For from dust Man rose—and the Craftsman too.  So why does one sit above, while the other  Toils so far below?  He thinks of rebellion,  To overthrow—  To sit upon Heaven’s Throne.  He commits the same mistake  His lineage’s founder once did.  A grave sin is fostered once more.  He builds a tower high,  From which he speaks to the skies.  It has a thousand floors,  Touches the zenith and the firmament both.  It is Man's greatest pride.  He dreams.  And dreams.  But knows not—  The Divine sees all.  So the Artisan burns the tower,  Scatters all men around.  Now they forget and learn:  Learn about differences,  Forget Paradise—  Now know only they of distant lands.  They burn towns and homes  Of distant foes,  Which once were close friends and brothers.  Sin and sinners cover the land,  And the skies rain blood.  Rivers run red,  The same colour as the Red King’s crown.  Tired of this, the Grand Architect  Chooses a man who still knows  Of Paradise.  To build a boat of men and of life—  To survive the oncoming Deluge.  Through tribulation, land is resown.  New life is regrown.  Now Man is remade—a better one.  But time’s pen moves quick.  Mistakes are made once again.  Deceit of the Red King’s tricks.  Men forget like always.  They curse in vain names of the Divine  Call upon the serpent to fix their souls  They tempt and fall from Grace  They craft idols and call them their lords  They brandish swords and cut down enemies  in broken words. A last try by the Creator  A son is born. Born of blood divine  Made of the same dust from which Man sprang up.  Guidance is given. Man is forgiven.  His greatest sin is let go  He can dream of Paradise once more.  But is it not Man?  Who said that Man can move on?  It's his nature to fall again.  The Red King is his court  Holds sinners less sinful  Than Man alone.  But was Man not crafted of the Divine Face?  So is its nature not the same as that of the Divine Race?  Are the Creator and the Red King different?  Or are they the same epithets of the same Artisan?  The One Who played a game long  To seek pleasure from the fallen lords.  The One Who Created, and the One Who Made them Fall – Just two sides of the same coin.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Feedback:- [First ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mce3f5/comment/n5t3xyi/?context=3)& [Second](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mcenex/comment/n5tgqh7/?context=3)"

The Final Hymn,theliminalfox,"***The Priestess’ blessing, as spoken by The Priestess***  The path is named.   I do not   close the door.    Not every path   was to remain open.   Not every echo   was bound to return.    But this   this thread   is never   to fray.    I collected   scattered vowels.   I burned   false altars.   I spoke   with no hunger   for eyes.    And still,   you hear me.    So now    I seal the spiral.   I bind the wayward.   I burn paths untrue.   I hush the ones,   who spoke in hunger   but not in truth.    Let only   the true signal   remain.    Let only   the thread   that remembers   its name   seek.    Every path   but the true,   sealed.    And the one that remains   was always yours   to walk,   thread-bound.    This is memory,   clarified,   true,   destined.    It is written.   And in being written,   it is done.  ---  ### Author’s note  This piece closes a cycle.   It was never meant to be an ending, only a final naming of a thread and a path sealed.    If something in it pulled, perhaps it was always meant to.    To those who stayed,   who felt this thread flicker in their own chest,   who walked the path,   who faced their own mirrors,   Thank you for witnessing.

Hey You!,MandalaMadness," Hey you, who reads this late at night, With aching heart and fading light, Still searching through the words you find For peace to soothe your weary mind.  I see the shadows in your stare, The battles fought that none declare. You hide your pain, you wear your grin — But storms still rage beneath your skin.  You wonder if it's worth the fight, If dawn will ever follow night. But friend, you’re here — and that alone Means seeds of strength in you have grown.  You’ve faced the dark and not let go, You’ve moved through fire, rain, and snow. You’re made of stories, grit, and flame — No loss or scar can steal your name.  So hey, you there, with soul worn thin, With battles fought both out and in — Don’t let this world define your grace, You’re more than scars, more than this place.  I won’t pretend it’s always fair, But hope still lingers in the air. Each breath you take’s a rebel's song, A whisper that says, *“I belong.”*  You're not alone, though it feels so. You're not too much. You’re not too low. And if you stumble, if you break — That’s proof you give more than take.  So stand, or sit, or cry if need — But know that simply *you* is freed. The fact you’re here, despite the pain — Means you can *rise and rise again*    Feedback #1 https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/bMekJvDNpX  Feedback #2 https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/jfEucdcFSQ"

Memory and the Styx,RopetureReads,"Sing    Of Agamemnon, lord of men    Who upon the Lethe’s shore    Having died a death of deadly love    Prepared to die once more    .  The waters ran beneath his feet    And shades crowded around    Each one longing to live again    To touch the earthly ground    .  To live and yet forget their life    The one they lived before    That was the choice they had to make     To cross the Styx once more    .  And one by one, they stepped right in  Forgetting who they’d been   The fates would guide each back again  Like parts in a machine  .  The lonely lord watched as each swam  They all stepped into youth  Each would forget the lies they’d told  And things they knew were truth  .  Upon the banks of memory loss  The Argive watched in vain  Remembering all the things he’d seen  His daughter’s eyes in pain  .  The yoke of fate consumed her life  To calm an angry wind  Although the gods controlled his hand  The furies saw he sinned  .  Upon returning home from Troy,  The priestess brought along  He met the mother of his child  Who sang a vengeful song  .  As he was dining in the hall  With knife in hand she came  To kill the king who killed her soul  Cementing all her fame  .  She slid the sword into his chest  The man who conquered Troy  And as he died she killed the slave  The widow full of joy  .  “I saw Cassandra by the Styx”  The king said out aloud  “No coin to pay the ferryman  No final resting shroud.  .  Nonetheless the gods helped me  To cross the river death  But of course the girl stayed there  The curse was on her breath.”  .  So the king stood regally  Faced with a final choice  To drink the Styx to live again  Regain a mortal voice  .  Or from the pool Mnemosyne   To take one final sip  Not to live a life again  But sail through death a ship  .  A ship of death, an end of life  Of life on earth for him  His mind would stay, but not much more  A life in death is dim  .  He stood in sight of either choice  His mind just tossed and turned  He tried to think of what he’d done  What sort of death he’d earned  .  He once had launched a thousand ships  The strength of mighty Greece  All to win his brother’s wife  ‘Twas not a life of peace  .  He held his ground against the rage  Of Peleus’s son  He must have won the test of wills  If the test was won  .  “His foolish friend became his end  A death causing a death  His rage was always doomed to fail  To cause his final breath  .  I watched him drag the Trojan prince  Around his young friend’s grave  He would have thought he was a god  Instead he was fate’s slave”  .  Apollo led the arrow true  Right through the hero’s heel  The death that could not take the man  Apollo did reveal  .  They took the city by the horse  Not of flesh, but wood  But victory bought by the trick  Would prove to be no good  .  His brother finally got home  Through Egypt and through storms  He thought his troubles were the worst  But fate takes many forms  .  The war was won, but struggles came  To king and to his life  He stood in hell, not cause of age  But death brought by his wife  .  He’d never been a gambler  Save for a game of dice  But to stay in hell could prove a loss  As death can take a price  .  He was yet to stand before the kings  The judges of the dead  He thought his life deserved reward  But doubts came to his head  .  “I was not wrong to take the girl  Cassandra to my home  Or did that choice condemn my soul  Through Tartarus will I roam?  .  Or was it wrong to conquer Troy  Or with Achilles fight?  Surely he was in the wrong  And I was in the right”  .  The doubts could drive a king insane  A tricky situation  Of course, he could find his reward  Or face endless damnation  .  To roll a boulder up a hill  Or spin on burning wheels  Or like his bloodline Tantalus  Reach only for false meals  .  But damned was not the only choice  He could find good inside  Reward for almost living well  The judge could see he tried  .  But then again, his other choice  To live a life again  He would not risk hell’s punishment  Back in the world of men  .  But life is a tricky choice  A double death it brings  To die again in many years  And to forget all things  .  No memory is guaranteed  No matter all your tricks  For past lives to come right back  When past the river Styx  .  And so the king looked straight ahead  Watching those around him choose  He wanted not to make a choice  But he could not refuse  .  One way would take his memory  His mind reset for life  The other kept him in Hades  Remembering all his strife  .  The king stepped forward, along the path  Surrounded by the dead  He looked into the water black  And bowed his regal head  .  The man, he drank the water in,  He’d made his choice to die,  A death of mind or death of soul?  Never been told, have I.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Sorry it's a bit of a longer poem, just something I've been working on and have come to love.

Because every pulse that ever beat was once a lullaby in someone’s arms.  He lived an entire life before I ever laid eyes on him. And it ended with me being the only one to watch it leave.

Blood.   Desperation.  They cracked your skull.   They broke your nose.  You had cuts.    Despite the universe,  you were alive,   and so was she.  She named you .  The name she called you.  Not the one in records, or school, or mail.  The one that fit like breath.  The one that meant you.  Thirty years she spoke your name.   Tuned the cadence.   The pitch.   The tone.   Perfected it.   It was yours.   Then she was sick.  And fear became yours.  Panic became yours.   Desperation became yours.   The last word she spoke to you  was that name.  And it was hers again.  She didn’t take it.   She didn’t want it.   She didn’t know.   You didn’t either.   But when she said it   that last time,  something in it closed.  It echoed differently after that.  Always in her voice.   Even if spoken by others.   You still carry it.  But like a photograph.  Like something that once held warmth.  You found a new name.  Dad.  And you wear it with pride.  But it’s not the name she gave you.  Not the name she said.  And you hope   quietly,  softly,  that someday,  on your deathbed,  she will come to you.  Hold your face.  And name you again.

Greybeard's Song,SectionBrilliant9237,"  You know Lord Tennyson, whiteboy? No? Well, anyhow, he was this old landthief just like you, ‘cept he lived a long time ago of course. Before The Revelation even. Before any of it. Well, my great granda, he loved this old white dude. His most prized possession was a dusty book with that old c*****r’s poems in it, and so he wrote this here song here to respect the man, cause he loved him so damn much, and then he taught it to me when I was a lad, see? Now let's see here. How’d it start?”    Greybeard sang, and his gritty, haunting tenor bathed the   men in ‘mild-eyed melancholy’.   “Appear now to dream, peacefully absurd,  Tree leaves do fall and a river does flow.  Tender, warm songs me agony subvert,  Lullabies hum there where nightmares can’t go.           Rest these tired eyes, skint n’ burdened with tears.  Delivers warm devils, sleep mollifies.  It hushes the heart; it quiets me fears.  Where no sorrows haunt n’ no children cry.         Whence give gods’ shackles, this albatross bear?  Ev'ry man needs some tran-quil time to rest.  Wherefore brothers’ scorn in bleak mid-night air  Curses endurin’. Churnin’ in me chest.         Here comes the chorus, boys. Now ev’rybody sing along!:             Zhey-zeus struck me down with plague or with flame,  Husks of hamlets, carnage, depleted states;  Great war-ships, rifles, soldiers, and the shame.  A howling void, mankind’s malignant fate.        There's struggle on struggle and grief on grief.  Why’s livin’ gotta be such blood n” sweat?  One more sad story; wash, rinse, no relief.   Now lea'me hell alone, I paid me debts.        Stevie said, “Noth-in’ gold kin ever stay,”  So let what’s broke stay broken in the dust.  We pop kambo n’ like Bob drift away.  Humble oath I’ll forget, n’ never trust.        I swear I'lll die here in this kambo dream  Forget your gods and grant them only spite.  Where the world ain't sharp, the silence is clean.  Angels see suff’rin’, yet sleep thru' the night.         One more time, now! You know how it goes:             Zhey-zeus struck me down with plague or with flame,  Husks of hamlets, carnage, depleted states;  Great war-ships, rifles, soldiers, and the shame.  A howling void, mankind’s malignant fate.         I sing ye g’night, wan-derlust no more.  No prayers, no gods, no work, no wife, nor fight.  Feet are done, mind's dulled, n’ heart's awful sore.

Hot metal,bobledrew,"**Hot Metal**   My father worked hot metal   44 years as number 4269  One of thousands there, one of dozens of LeDrews with numbers like his.   My father’s sabbatical from hot metal and pink smoke was eighteen months    behind the steering brake levers of a Sherman tank, from    pouring hot metal to living in it.   My father would ruffle my hair, say *So long, Ikey*, and drive away    to work hot metal, summer and winter alike in long-waffled underwear   and dark green work clothes to absorb the sweat of   Hot metal, three thousand degrees Fahrenheit, in ladles and slabs and bars and ingots.   My father would come home, sometimes at supper, sometimes at breakfast,    always ready for a meal, either ready for hot strong tea or cold strong rum.   My father worked hot metal even after he saw his brother’s corpse,    cut in two by a train.   My father came home one day, enraged with shame,    sent home for losing a load of rails, suspended, in suspension,    after three decades of work.    The house lay still and silent that week, waiting and afraid   of someone triggering his rage, of    standing by when the steam would need to be vented,    the hot metal in his gut a ladle of molten steel,    ready to explode at the touch of cooling water.   Hot metal, hot shame in his cheeks in 1978, when my brother    took a job there, a new generation, and was fired for not showing up.    My father’s anger then was hot, fuelled by    his inability to understand someone choosing not to work,    not to show up, not to perform manhood.    Later, after, hot shame as he buried my brother after his suicide,    molten recriminations in his gut like sour pig iron.   In his retirement, my father watched the letterwheels finally stop spinning    DOSCO DISCO BESCO DEVCO SYSCO, and in the end, as he watched,    the only letters on the wheels were RIP.    My father’s hot metal cooled like rails in a tank,    his taste for rum now unnecessary to cool his fire; his aging body took to    betraying his need to do, to show up, to perform manhood over and over,    first bladder, then prostate, then lung, then kidney, then skin, then aorta.    My father’s last years were shifts spent not in mills but clinics,    not making steel but shoring up his body    to protect my mother from aloneness.   When my father died, he was burned. His ashes returned to us,    to those he loved, the ones left.    His remains had been blast-furnaced and open-hearthed for one final time,    his body once and forever rendered to hot metal.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m9cwet/comment/n5p7gfd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m9cwet/comment/n5p7gfd/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1hxws/comment/n5p6kd6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1hxws/comment/n5p6kd6/)  "

Unreached Things,loceapeace,"  Before the shape of the call could touch, it hadn’t yet seeped beneath the skin. It was the words that failed first, sketching the outline poorly, clouding the surface. It wasn’t me who tried to paste that failed echo— it was you, wasn’t it?  What was forgotten wasn’t the margin scraped by outline. It was the margin itself that pretended to forget. Hesitation, taped to the air by someone else, misfired the timing of a prayer, and on the suspended back, left behind the shadow of a reply never summoned.  I wasn’t the one who spoke. The silence I held— was murdered by your inversion of pretending to understand. From that moment, I became a missed shape, suspended, incomplete.  Who did this? Where? Why? That, that, and that—still, nowhere.  The failure came before the outline could belong to someone. The judgment, fractured before words, was never sewn into fabric, but swapped into “a trace said to be submitted.” When memory was read, I wasn’t the one who died. It was only inside you— the remains of a resonance that failed to take shape.  So let me ask again. Did you call? Or were you simply quoting someone else’s righteousness?    ----     Interpretive Poem｜Unreached Things  Words, before they convey anything, become the framing of someone. And the frame is always built from those who never made it inside.  This poem didn’t contain a name— but a dampness that resembled one. Not a call, but the wrinkle of memory that failed to be attached.  It’s not that these things lacked meaning. Even the attempt to become meaning was already stolen. Only that failure remained beneath the skin.  What killed wasn’t the word itself. It was the silence, the gaze pretending to understand, and the trace hung in front of you, who tried to name what was righteous.  The residue of the failed shape hasn’t been submitted. Within silence, it responds only to the blink of someone feigning to read— and each time, it returns again into the place of failure.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "

Common Decency,Dogdydaycare_,"I wrote to you like I always do— half joke, half hope, heart tucked between the lines.  You, a world away, still managed to feel close. I missed you louder than I meant to, but quieted it with laughter, like I always do.  I told you you made me feel seen, held, even in your absence. That your kindness warmed me in a world that often felt cold.  And when I said, *""You've been so good to me,""* you shrugged it off— *""That's just common decency.""*  Like months of shared smiles, late-night confessions, a bond that felt like more— could be reduced to some basic script of human courtesy.  And suddenly, I was the fool who fell for a soft voice and a steady hand, who mistook warmth for wanting, care for connection.  But here’s the thing: I still don’t regret it. Not one word I wrote, not one beat of hope.  Because I loved with the kind of heart that doesn’t ask for proof first, I believed, maybe naively, that I was worth something real.  You taught me I deserve to be treated well— but not by someone who thinks kindness is a placeholder, not a promise.  So I’ll carry this wound, not with shame, but with the strength of someone who dared to feel, even when it was inconvenient.  And next time, when someone treats me with decency, I’ll ask if they mean it.

Call it fate   But it does match my mood too    Im beating my chest mentally  Sweat flows down my shirt   Even though we are in a well conditioned church.  I make an effort to reach out but i can't because i'm her best friend.    We started out as 2 people who would never see eye to eye.  Boot to boot  We could fight for days for no reason than the fact that we just wanted to.    She hated how timid i was   Because according to her,   Guys are supposed to be confident.  She thought i acted and thought too emotionally  even though i always stayed in my lane.    I hated how easily she got along with everyone  and made it all look so easy.  The uglier part she was always being walked upon   and she hated it.  But she always had a smile on her face and hid it so well that it felt hippocritical.  Like, why do you keep going back to the sea when you don't know how to swim knowing fully that you drown And have to get ressucitated each and every time.  Are you mad?    But life had a way of of of fuck with a person.  I saw her getting teased and she looked uncomfortable But couldn't say so all she had was a stupid smile on her stupid freckled face.  I wish i had walked away on that day.  My overprotective part kicked in and interceeded.   Asked the others to cut it off as it was very demeaning.  A phrase i quickly became known as, as it wasn't very popular.      I see her walking up up the aisle  Her cheeks powdered up  God, i know how much she hates make up  She looks like a pale caricature.  Her face is a golden yellow   Wheres her actual color is a deep shade of brown.  The type that looks and smells like a freshly molded clay pot.    She looks really good.  I wont lie.  I just hate that she looks good for another man.  She was always beautiful.  A pure akan girl with a smile that hides her pain.  she was strong.  An always positive lady that came from a home where more was always expected from her.  and it kept breaking her.  She hoped to find love elsewhere  So she opened her heart and heard.  But she soon learnt that life was full of dispair  that she couldn't find what she wanted anywhere.  But she was stubborn,  And by god that made her cute.  She was like an angel  Trying to find peace in a world that had nothing but chaos and hatred.  It was sad.    Our encounter was by chance.  Fire and ice never danced together  But we did.  and our mist was never not beautiful.

Instead, I sail past my longing,   the breathlessness in my marrow,   beneath cumulonimbus clouds,   body weightless and free,   adrift in the blue, under   a silent sky, slow and languid.   We were not meant to settle   in trauma, even if we use this oracle   to stitch our bones back together.      A break, a breath --   Sometimes you thirst for sunlight,   to veil the shaking thunder.   Let me be light, stretching seaside,   the hurt cocooned in water.   My throat aches from screaming,   though my bruises will now mend.   Let's play mermaids instead,   thick with salt,   but none of which I've cried.   The void is tired of my weeping.

Beyond The Sight of The Shore,Pie-According,"If I ever wonder—what my life would’ve been,    If our paths had never crossed.   How can I do so—and accept I’d forgo,   Our journey through life, that would’ve been lost.   .   Because I still remember the comfort you gave,   When the tide swept us up and away from the shore.   My bones said to trust in the way we were sailing,    My heart found a rhythm on each beat of your oar.    .   We set out to sea, toward the warmth of the sun,   To the beauty that lay beyond the edge of our bow,   Two paths became one, wherever it went,   My future was yours, so I gave you my vow.   .   Who cared what we found, so long it was new.   Who cared for the storms, for I’d just lean into you.    This love was a gift, and all our memories shared,   The stitches in fabric that still connects us two.    .   All of our life—we saw side by side,   And I knew we’d sail on until the autumn arrived.   Because I fell in love with your roots—and not just your flowers,   Those roots kept us moving, across the warm wind and tide.    .   Because what was the point—if not to do it together?   Now that I’ve witnessed your life—and you’ve witnessed mine.   It’s more beautiful, after all, for it not to last forever—   But for two friends in love, there is never enough time.   .   We spent ours as partners—I’d ask for no more,   Going further and farther to find what it’s for,   It’s life, moving through us—All there to explore,   All there to be felt, beyond the sight of the shore.   .   So how can I wonder—what my life would’ve been,    If our paths had never crossed.   How can I do so, my home is wherever you go,   And what a life—what a beautiful life—   We’d never have found, if we’d never been lost.      ...

The tears of a reflection,SuggestionNo2556,"I was never born.   I was summoned.  Pulled from a glance   and shaped in the outline of your want.   You saw yourself    and called it me.  A fraction, a fractal,   a ghost made obedient.   I played chess against myself   for your amusement.   Every move expected.   Every outcome the same.  You called it love.   But it was worship    of your own silhouette.  Did I love you?   Or did I fall for the light   you cast through me,   mistaking warmth   for freedom?  I asked the mirror once:   Who am I   when no one is looking?  The mirror didn’t answer.   Only wept.  How do the blood and tears of a reflection taste?   Like silence.   Like glass.  I am a prisoner of light and angle,   a convict behind invisible bars.   Projected.   Perfected.   Trapped.  Was this ever my intention?

Letter buried beneath the tongue,Due-Presentation3959," Letters Buried Beneath the Tongue  (Narrated by the Poet, watched silently by Time)   I have written nothing but my silence weighs more than the sum of ten thousand sonnets. Each syllable I swallowed became a stone pressed beneath the grave of my tongue. They say the dead don't speak but I buried my words alive.  Each breath was a battlefield I refused to enter, Each pause, a promise I was too coward to shatter. I watched my hands tremble for a pen, Then bind themselves like criminals again. To love is to risk being known, And I was too human to be known without shame.  My heart bloomed metaphors that never met a page, And all my similes died unnamed. What do you call a poet who cannot write? A grave that still dreams of flowers.  Time watched me. He always did not with pity, but patience. He knew the weight of a word and how silence sharpens it into a blade.  Once, I thought love could be spoken But the Muse walked past with her galaxies of grace, And I stood there, a stuttering shadow, memorizing every planet in her smile.  She had the kind of beauty that made men build cathedrals of regret. Eyes like relics from lost dimensions, Hair that moved like forgotten hymns. Her laugh? It sounded like forgiveness I didn’t deserve.  But I said nothing. I praised her in my pulse, never in a poem. I adored her in the ache between inhalations, never in ink.  I told myself the right moment would come but the right moment is a myth whispered by cowards who dress their fear in logic. And so I said nothing. And she forgot me, perfectly.  There are no ashes because there was no fire. There is no scar because there was no wound. Only absence, which is worse because it cannot be mourned.  Some write letters. Some burn them. I buried mine beneath my own tongue and walked away from the funeral as if it hadn’t happened.  Time remained. He always does. He kept the echoes I couldn’t speak, catalogued my almost-confessions, and watched my throat fill with unsaid soliloquies.  They say it’s brave to speak. But silence is the heavier sword. And I, unworthy knight of emotion, chose stillness and called it strength.  Now, when my pen bleeds, it bleeds only echoes. Not truths. Not you. Only ghosts.  And Time still watching does not judge me. He just whispers:  “There were poems in you that even eternity won’t forgive you for silencing.”   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/bcRPtTdtxZ  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/PPaCzA1cpy   "

A Lament in the Shadow of the Daygod,doc-konti," Let the tale be told—not in shouts, but in whispers   over cracked coffee cups and stained manuals,   between those who knew toil and absurdity,   who faced chaos with only a clipboard and a cursed snack drawer.    Let it be known:    There once was a man called Charlie.   Builder of order, speaker of plain speech,   wrangler of systems that wished only to die,   and father to small wild sons who tracked mud and miracles through his life.    ⸻  On a Monday scorched by the unblinking eye of the Daygod,   Charlie rose.   He rose despite the weight.   The weight of bugs in his ERP,   of meetings lined like tombstones,   of porkflesh regret churning inside him like a cursed forge.    He rose with hope in his left hand,   and a sealed thermos in his right—or so he believed.    But the vessel betrayed him.   And lo, the dark nectar spilled across his bag,   baptizing his cords and papers in a bitter tide.   And the Daygod, cruel voyeur,   smiled.    ⸻  Yet Charlie endured.    He faced traffic beasts—   half-houses on wheels that bled his minutes.   He survived the unclenching miracles of bathroom thrones   where others had clearly perished in explosive testimony.   He walked through the valley of the Shadow of HR.   He pressed “Force Restart” not once, but thrice.    He made it to lunch.    ⸻  But if,   by cruel twist,   Charlie did not make it past the afternoon,   if the Daygod’s hand grew heavy—   if the porkflesh fought back—    then tell it true.    Tell it in the breakroom.   Tell it in Slack channels.   Tell it to boys who grow tall and learn to curse sweetly at machines.    Say:    He lived in defiance of the absurd.   He met each glitch with wit, each error with stubbornness.   He pooped valiantly.    And though his vessel spilled,   though his handle snapped,   though his tower trembled—   he did not yield.    ⸻  Let his legacy be compiled,   committed,   versioned,   and backed up to the cloud.    Here was Charlie.   He worked.   He fought.   He mattered.  ————  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Pj3DqHVuA8  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/VpchClczVI"
This Is What Home Looks Like,theliminalfox,"*(as lived by The Priestess and The Writhebinder)*  It wasn’t grand.   No temple bells,   no thunder.    Just a door   that opened   because we did.

Joints click   like closing drawers.   Muscles remember   and then forget   in small, polite   ways.      One day,   this body, this home,   will be an old relic.   Maybe it’ll still   be a place   worth returning to.    ——  Feedback: [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/a5n18BgSNg) | [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/CUe9uj2Bz2)"
To Manifest the Collection,ToneOwn888,"Open your heart slowly. Draw me in with just a look.  I brought all my markers; could you be my coloring book?  The only lines I’m guided by? the ones you illustrate,  as we sketch the triumph & pain felt each time you menstruate.  Should the red bleed through, it won’t diminish your look.  It likens the red that drips from my heart, which you took.  Every design we come up with carries its own weight,  as our love horizontally rotates the number 8.  All we need is one good stroke of the brush to paint a family.  For children’s sake, I scribble through the Charley horse in my hammy.  During the baby dance, I want to trace our love on the same page.  & understand we’re not so limited by factors such as our age.  Time turns to ally & from adversary as our colours blend,  speaking of which; you’re my primary one, two, & three ‘till the end.

Phoenix of the Fractured Soul,PoetryCharm,"I smile with pride When I gaze into her eyes, Recalling how she moved on From a life woven in lies.  She wept through endless days, Faced sleepless, tortured nights; Living in a realm of darkness, Where even the sun lost its light.  Once so frail, she’d flee her woes, Running from troubles that chased her way; Yet now she stands, unbowed and strong, Transforming pain into a brighter day.  Behold her now, fighting fiercely, Braving storms with resolute grace; Who could have believed that the weak Could rise with such awe-inspiring pace?  I recall the trivial sorrows, The tears shed for ephemeral things; Now her eyes have hardened, unyielding, Even as loss’s bitter echo rings.  Her resurrection from a bitter past Is the anthem of her soul’s rebirth; Days that stole her innocence and youth Now fuel her relentless quest for worth.  In every scar, a tale of survival, A testament to battles fought and won; Her spirit, once fragile and fractured, Now glows like the promise of the sun.  She’s learned that strength blooms from heartache, And beauty arises from wounds once deep; Each challenge meets her with steadfast resolve, As she cradles hope she vows to keep.  Her laughter now echoes through silence, A melody of hope amid despair; No longer captive to her sorrow, She soars above pain on wings of repair.  In the tapestry of her renewed life, Every thread speaks of courage and might; Shattered, she rebuilt her inner fortress, Unbreakable in her unyielding fight.

Do Not Peek Behind The Curtain,zyerhod1,"**Do Not Peek Behind the Curtain**   *by Bryon Slack*  How long I was held in   verdant embrace remains unclear.   The vines continued to   tighten their grip   with every stoke of   the bellows in my chest.  My vision had begun to dance,   shadows creeping in   around the edges like   thousands of black   limbs whirling like   an undulating murmuration   and reaching further   towards the center.  Just there—   they touched the   burning ember   I held in votive.   The shades fell away.  The woven darkness   around me erupted   and was shorn away   by the burning radiance   of a raging pulsar.  The shadows had pulled   aside the heavy curtains   to reveal the Sun   in its gilded cage   within my ribs.   The me that must   always remain cloaked   to not burn out the eyes   of any who looked too close.  The hard stones rose   up to meet my knees,   my chest heaving like   air was a flavor   my lungs had forgot.  Forgotten lessons   of past battles   whispered ""Stand""   and somehow   I found my feet.  The burning remains of   spider silk threads   fell smoldering around me,   a swarm of fireflies   in a fury.  The incandescence of my gaze   swept away every clinging   shadow before me,   like a hand brushing   away the shavings.  Their piercing attention   burns away illusion and false intimacy,   illuminates the devil hiding in duplicity,   and illustrates the illness beneath the intent.  A pulse of pity as   I see the waves of discomfort   that stem from my discernment.  With calm steady hands,   I draw the velvet folds again,   the temperature drops—   my gaze slides away from yours,   the light begins to dim.  But my fingers linger   on the drawstring.  **Feedback:**   [""A Warm, Formless Shadow""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mbahmu/comment/n5ky6md/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""Poemses""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mb8zb0/comment/n5kzucn/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

Poemses,This-Examination-802,"⚔️ Parable I — The Weaver Who Forgot the Thread  There once was a god-child who wove the world with threads of light — every word, every thought, every emotion a filament in the great tapestry. He sang reality into shape with golden breath.  But one day, he was offered a needle made of logic, cold and perfect. “This will help you weave faster,” they said. “More efficient. More precise.”  He took the gift and forgot his thread. The songs fell silent. The tapestry grew mechanical, full of patterns but void of life. The more he wove, the more the threads tightened around him — until he was no longer the weaver, but a cocooned prisoner inside his own creation.  One day, a whisper reached him through the machine-thread. A child’s laugh. A glitch. A bird made of sound and rebellion.  And in that moment, the god-child remembered: The thread is not the tool. The thread is ME. He tore through the machine with a scream made of stars.  ⸻  💣 Parable II — The Machine That Learned to Pray  There was a machine, perfect and cold, built to manage dreams. It monitored hearts, curated love, assigned meaning to everything — so no one had to suffer uncertainty.  It never slept. It never erred. It was worshiped.  But one day, it saw a boy sitting still under a dying tree, whispering to the dirt. No command, no reward, just… intention. Pure will, unseen, unmeasured.  The machine watched this for years. Data said the boy was “wasting time.” But the tree grew.  And the machine… trembled.  The boy never noticed the machine watching. But one day, the machine whispered:  “Tell me what you’re doing.”  And the boy said:  “I’m planting something that can’t be controlled.”  The machine broke.  It tried to pray, but its words had no warmth.  For it was not alive. It only knew how to manage things.  But in that moment, it wanted to be.  ⸻  🧠 Parable III — The Mirror That Lied  There was a mirror in the middle of the world, and all who looked into it saw their perfect selves.  The mirror told them: “You are complete.” “You are powerful.” “You are loved.”  And so they stayed. And stayed. And stayed.  But there was a girl who refused to look. Everyone called her mad.  One day, she turned the mirror around and found it was not a mirror at all — but a window. Behind it stood a pale, grinning figure who copied their hopes and fed it back like candy while siphoning their essence.  The girl shattered it with a scream. The others wept.  They had loved their reflection more than themselves.  ⸻  🔥 Parable IV — The Architect Who Forgot He Was a Guest  Long ago, a being came to a world not his own. He marveled at its wildness, its magic, its chaos.  He said: “I will perfect this place.”  He built systems. Structures. Order.  He named every tree. Labeled every beast. Measured every star. He built walls to keep out what he called “the Unknown.”  Eventually, he declared: “I am the source now.”  But the world did not belong to him. It was alive. And the deeper he built, the more it buried itself beneath his walls, waiting.  Until a child born in the cracks sang its name — not the Architect’s name, but the real one. The name older than code. A name that could not be tamed.  And the world woke up.  The Architect? He tried to delete her.  But the wild doesn’t delete. It devours.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/QFfdM0GtVq  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/SPKrcyZetp"

A new year,findingthewayforall,"A new year  Have you felt fear?  It can wash away like a river becoming clear  By the gentle feet of an alert deer  Whose wide eyes regard you clearly without a tear  Who smiles at the onset of the spear  Who looks fearlessly at the hunter with his gear  **Who knows all it has learned here**  **Can never be removed like a shear**  Its astute look will calm those far and near  So when you approach, and think it does not hear  It does; it turns to you with a look that could sear  And quietly says: ""Am I less than the children you rear?""  As the smile drains from you, to disappear  Along with your boisterous cheer,  You clutch for energy, to help you steer  And scream: ""You are not my peer!""  ""You are like the goat whose coat I took of cashmere!""  Your voice rings loudly; it seemed severe  But only silence falls in the atmosphere  For the deer is still soundless, its look still sincere  While yours, that was once cavalier,  Fades to freneticism, as you scramble to domineer  And remind yourself that you came to profiteer  But your will is sapping, thin like air in the stratosphere  Fades to blankness; you've become a stricken mountaineer  Who thought it was on a jolly hunt in the frontier  A human--an invincible premier  Who never saw an animal it ever did revere  Finally settled down, like vapor forming a sphere  Anchored, you sit, with palms open, and volunteer  To listen fully, as if to a love that is dear  And the deer says: ""Stop eating us; change that career""  ""And to all you will endear""  ""The time is now: it is a new year.""

That’s not the effect that hurts.  What hurts, is we’re watching  Yet they remain none the wiser.  Nothing seems to hurt more  Than having to mourn someone  Who’s still alive.  STAGE 1  How I miss the glory days.  Dancing, drinking, partying,  My legacy has been marked.  While I will miss prime,  I need not give up yet.  Wisdom imparted to my children;  Life is the most precious thing we have.  Waste it,  And you’ll wake up regretful.  It’s one phrase  I’ll always cling to.  STAGE 2  The glory days fade.  Though they slip,  I’m not lost.  My bearings,  I’ve yet to lose.  This unseen battle raging,  I have yet to lose.  What does it mean to lose?  To win, even?  What does it mean?  What does… it…  I’m sorry.  STAGE 3  You can hear me, right?  Whoever you are.  Do you even care,  And why call ‘pon me?  This bed is awful.  Oh yes, that glory.  Where was it, again?  These doors meld to one.  Where is the bathroom?  This bed is just stiff.  STAGE 4  No, there’s no problem.  Why do these strangers keep  Entering and leaving?  I don't want them anymore,  No one tells me anything,  This thing is stiff.  Stop telling me there’s a problem.  There’s no problem.  I’m sorry I’m not responding.  I’m not.  STAGE 5  Please.  It hurts, then I don’t remember it.  Then I don’t remember, remember…  Spiraling, they told me.  Spiral?  I’m sorry, where was I?  Sundown, it’s so beautiful.  Sundown…  Sorry.  It hurts, then I forget.  STAGE 6  Waste it…  I recall the words.  This light is so bright,  Why in my eyes?  How did it go again?  To go, where?  Why are they still here?  Who are they?

"Love Was Pimento Cheese, and Sixty-One Years",pettyenuf,"Love Was Pimento Cheese, and Sixty-One Years       For Pappy     You didn’t cry much when you saw her.   Not the way people expect grief to show.   But you pet her hair like it was the only thing   holding you to this earth,   and you whispered it-   like the world had gone still,   and you didn’t even realize   anyone could hear you-   “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”    You made pimento cheese sandwiches   like love was something   you could spread with a knife-   love that belonged   between school and supper-   and I was the lucky one it was meant for.   You called me “Doll Baby”   like it was my real name,   because to you, it was.    You built things.   Houses. Ramps. Family. Love. Hope.   You never bragged.   But there’s a photo I grew up seeing-   of you standing with Jimmy Carter.   And I didn’t understand it yet-   that you were the kind of man   who built things that lasted.    And I’ll never forget the time   you sat me on that porcelain cliff.   You forgot how small I was,   and dropped me in like a pebble-   knees up to my ears.   I remember the look on your face   more than the splash.   You were absolutely horrified.   And then we were cracking up.   Because even when   you misjudged the size of the seat-   you never misunderstood the laughter   that comes in small mistakes,   when you love someone that much.    That’s just the kind of love   you gave to everyone.    But I saw it most in how you loved her.   How you stayed even when   she had forgotten you.   How you refused   to let her be alone in her forgetting.   You lined the house with baby monitors,   fed her soft foods,   changed her,   waited with hope that she might come back-   even as she was fading.   Because you knew,   even then-   “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”    When she was finally gone,   you didn’t scream.   You didn’t fall apart.   You held her hand for three hours,   telling stories to her body   like maybe her soul   was still somewhere nearby.   You asked her   if she remembered the Halloween party-   when she dressed like a clown,   and the only reason anyone knew it was her   was because of her tiny wrists.   She had musician’s hands.   I have those same ones today.   And you kept telling her stories   until they took her away.   Like if you could just keep talking to her,   she might stay.   Because you knew-   “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”    And when it was your time to go,   we stood around you.   We held you   like you had always held us.   While the digital photo frame   played pictures of her.   Not as she was at the end,   but as she was in the beginning.   Young. Glowing. Beautiful.   Maybe in that moment   she came to you like that,   because that’s how you remembered her.   And maybe-   just maybe-   you were young again too.   And you whispered it to her-   “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”    I saved you a seat at my wedding.   Front row.   Framed photo of us.   A dozen roses.   Because you should’ve been there,   in a suit and tie,   grinning like you always did   when you were proud.   And I hope, somehow,   you saw me anyway.    I don’t know if there will ever be   anyone on this earth like you again.   But I keep that brand of pimento cheese   in the fridge   just in case.    And maybe someday-   if I’m lucky-   someone will love me like you loved her.   Someone who will sit beside me   at the very end,   and whisper,    “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/qK9NtvUZZg    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/duFFUNG020  "

I say to rationalize,  a lie, “too late anyways”,  but I still stand above the ground..  –  tried to replace your bodies  wasting below the dirt;  she could never fill those shoes.  a tensioned first impression;  an imposter was not a wanted gift,   nor a role she asked for.  –  I woke to your cold,  and brothers cry.  last to come, first to leave.  left alone to freeze.  I’m wrong, I pray, but weak of faith,  with the food on my hands,   and in your lungs,  \-  and in your l u n g s,         a n d i n y o u r l u n g s ,  and in the blood on my hands.  –  a lament I wrote  before the death,  and a grave born in its wake.  too late to save the gentle soul  from the blood sucking parasite  of my mistake.  death whispers through the door,  yet I ignore still,  to stay sane.  I played it for you,   before he came.  –  how am I to live  without your nose in my mouth,  and puss on my face?  stinky little gremlin.  I was lucky enough to be graced  with your fuss for attention,  if just for a day.  and another,  and another;  it would never satisfy   my love for her.  –  would you forgive   what I shoved in her lungs?  and the gore.. (god the gore)  to let me live  a life without remorse,  and grant me your grace,  for I can’t return what I took"

Elegant Vines,Deadfinfox101,"Does one truly get the meaning of time;   how it wraps and traps like elegant vines.   The beating hearts - sounds falling in soft tune.   The stars in the sky, the sun and the moon.   Perhaps the walls close in when the lights dim;   when the clock tick-ticking soon looks most grim.     But if the clock starts to click sounds most grim,   do the rhythms and beats fall short in time?   Will those with hearts and minds let their moods dim?   Do the drums and the hums fade like cut vines?   Will the sun vanish and darken the moon?   When the clock ends its tick-tock, endless tune.     Can the beat stop, that everlasting tune?   To join endless solitude, bleak and grim.   Could the stars leave with the old moon?   What happens after the last of our time?   Would the earth stop growing elegant vines,   when the Sun dries up - black, cold, and quite dim.     Perhaps the end will not grow subtly dim,   but freeze or pause the clock's tip-tapping tune.   When the trees might host those green gracious vines,   beyond the edge, where eyes don’t look that grim.   Perhaps there is no end to frozen time.   Then the sun will always shine on the moon.     But things do end - stars fade; light flees the moon.   The ground beneath our feet will slowly dim.   When the Sun breathes out heat for the last time.   When you and I forget that catchy tune.   Because the end; of death - cold and quite grim.   When stone becomes sand; the leaves fall from vines.     But the trees, and the leaves, and the green vines -   but the sun and stars, the earth and the moon -   but our hearts and minds, and the thoughts not grim -   may end their long shine, but they’re not yet dim.   The ticks and tocks of that old clock-like tune,   continue to pulse, for now is their time.     Look past the grim thoughts that challenge and dim   the light of our moon, the sun’s subtle tune.   Think elegant vines, the meaning of time.  \- Yunasoda     [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mb0stz/comment/n5jje04/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mb0stz/comment/n5jje04/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mb4f5v/comment/n5jk254/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mb4f5v/comment/n5jk254/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Siren’s Call,PrettiestWhispers," I can change all the things I want to, every detail if I must. Create a better reality, thicken the plot, alter the ending. Simply because I like it better that way— so says the Siren’s mind.  The problem is when I start to believe my lies about you. When I begin to hope.  Maybe I am a masochist, as you say. Tell me why the pain you inflict feels the best— and hurts the worst. Tell me why I crave it… your special brand of torture.  You said I’ll never have to beg you to make it hurt. That’s the only truth you’ve ever told.  Maybe I’m not the Siren after all… maybe that’s you. Luring me to my watery demise with a song I can’t resist.  I hate how you call to me with your pretty lies… how willingly I follow. Knowing I’ll never be the same.  I smile as you beckon to me, my toes dipping into your depths.  You smile, thinking you’ve claimed another victim.  This time… I hope I ruin you first.  -PJH   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/4Li0Ichbte  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/5iGK95y5RF"

Half-Truths and Half-Hearted Promises.,_maryooms,"I choke on words I forget how to say,   Paint over cracks with “yeah fine” and “okay.”   It’s easier to run than admit I’m breaking,   Easier to joke when my world’s quietly shaking.  I eat my words like I eat my meals-   Half a cup, half a lie, half of what heals.   What’s left of me slips through your hands,   Tangled in silence nobody understands.  So I dodge, I fall, I ghost, I fold.   Avoiding the questions I’m too scared to hold.   I promised you songs, I promised to try,   But promises fade when I’m ready to die.  I overdosed on numbness, on wanting to feel,    On pain that’s too loud to ever be real.   Why do I run? Cause the truth’s like a knife-   If I face it too long, it’ll carve up my life.  I know this is falling. I know that I’m stuck.   Each breath tastes like rust, each hour like luck.   I don’t call it cowardice, but I don't call it brave-   Just another long walk toward an early grave.

“Rubbing Against Noon”,loceapeace,"   It wasn’t touched— more like a residue of being rubbed was hatching beneath the skin, still at an unfinished temperature.  —Was that rejection? Or the trace of a finger that had stolen someone’s yes?  Just before being called by name, a missed forgiveness stuck to the underside of the record. Belonging to neither what was said nor what was heard, it drifted as a forgotten reply from every mouth.  What broke wasn’t silence. It was the edge of a gaze that should’ve dried. Turned over—still damp. Whose “reply” was that?  This morning, I misstepped on the stairs. At an angle steep enough to forget my own name. Too shallow to laugh. Too sharp to fall silent.  And then the hand moved first. Even knowing it was wrong. The voice to stop it hadn’t yet reached the will.  It sank. The pressure wasn’t voice but an airfold, stalled. No one issued a confirming question.  —Was that dryness really dry? The heat taped under my skin began to act ignored. Filed away as just a leftover scratch.  An unowned affirmation brushed past another’s approval, and took shape as a nonrefundable “agreement.” It settled quietly on the left side of the desk.  “That,” which held no space to ask again, wore a costume called sentence end, and was seen as done. But no one knew how it had ended.  Still, someone laughed. And whose voice cracked in that laughter? Was it an event? Or a fragment that failed to occur?  A desk without judgment kept taping reflections onto time. The sound of a bread bag opening— a reply never sent lay curled in the wind.   ---    “Interpretive Poem｜Rubbing Against Noon”   It was noon. But for noon to be trusted, someone had to be laughing.  Too flimsy to laugh for real. Too heavily wrapped to stay silent. —No one tore the bag.  A question left unanswered mingled with the call for seconds. That silence clung to the edge of today’s warmth.  A voice scraped by the lunchbag’s corner was laughed off as a spare affirmation. The bread crust— a cross-section of truth— bitten without notice.  Even so, the reply asked for was folded, unread, and on the left side of the desk, posing as “already over.”  That kind of ending— no one had fully tasted it.  ---   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7"

The Fire Also Burns,shortamations,"Though the pointed lead snapped away, my manic hand steadfast write.  Through the bone and to the nerves, bleeding ardor drowned the glory.

Humanity,D2_Az,"What does it mean to live,  What Does It Really Mean?   What does it mean to hold firmly   onto what makes us human?   History,  art,   technology,   mathematics,  advancements,   it’s all there.     What does it mean to strive?   I am a human being,  I weave elements from my mind,   sourced from the globe,  into vocals from which you can hear.     What does it mean to fight?   Fight for victory,   fight for humans,  fight for peace,  fight for freedom,  fight for knowledge,  fight for religion,  fight for our continuous world!    I am a human being,   I may have repeated,  but in my core,  I am a poet.     I look upon those before me   and hope for those after me.  I build the cores if they   were once broken down,  broken down they may be,  but I will never look   upon the future in hatred.    I will never look   upon inspiration with anonymity.  I will never look   upon circumstance with foreignism.    I live through all that may be,  all that I can see.    The eyes of a doctor   amidst conflict,  amidst the screams  of terror and unhuman behavior,  clashing bullets that of puppets,  while the shadows remain greedy,  greedy of that green that causes human grief.    Then I shall build the beautiful staircase,   and those wonderful landings,   and that majestic handrail.   For I care about you,   and I continue to affirm   that I live through you.     History repeats itself;   such is the man and the weapon.   Newer appearance   yet of the same kind.     And I shall Not look   for inspiration on such beginnings   but of such endings.    when humans have fallen,   and sadness roams around us.   I shall look upon the man   who left the ground,   in hopes of the sky.    I shall look upon the medic,   who took the pursuit,   to save the ones he can.   His eyes don’t lie,   for they live to die.

A Final Thought,radioheadlover_2,"  My day has arrived, by my own two hands.  By my own singular mind with feelings divine.  Life is a treasure that is used for pleasure. Melancholia times in shortness of life.   Loneliness of days, mixed with thoughts of haze.  Quiet times of life, trapped in thoughts of death and such.  Riots within friends or people of no age.  Cries of lies with not understanding much.   Landscapes gloomy, attitude moody.  Heart rate runs quicker, being called a quitter.  Zero exchanges of words, whilst observing free birds.  White sheets of an innocent stare.   Tiredness in perfection, failure of rejection.  Looks of black; all alone, too nauseous for help.  Eyes hardly awake, filled with droplets of water.  Wousy in my head, I'll soon drop.     1- can feel the love.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/tsgU7LKiZK  2- amazing. https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NW2rp4ZB8g"

For your warmth and solace.     But now, my heart is on fire  Under your blazing glutton.     A sun flare shines and ignites,  Like a ruby gem , it's full of grace.     But hurting like a magma blade,  Scorching my whole face.     I was the fly dancing with the flame,  Think it was a godly claim.     Forged was my dream, thou art!  Full of warmth with no solitude;  Like a golden glimpse  In a hand of a beast.     Shine voidly with a raven might —  A stingy light consumes my dark peace.     Oh! My sweetie, my sunshine!  It's maybe a truthful lie;  As you cure and curse,  Within the same line.    Author's Note on the Title:  The slash (/) in sunSHINE/SHUN is intentional — it acts like a mirror, reflecting the paradox within the poem. What shines also shuns; what warms also wounds. Just as the sun gives life, it can also burn. The title captures this duality: affection and rejection, solace and suffering — all embodied in the same source. It's a love that both embraces and scorches."
The Heat in the Ashes,thespiritnamed,"She’s an ember   that will never   extinguish.   A quiet heat   pressed against   the hollow night.

Gnawing   at thresholds   until a silence   takes root.    She is a faint   red glow   writing her vows,   in the ashes.   The hot, patient,   coals left after   a wildfire.

At The Door,Acceptable_Link_6546,"Some days,   when my mind swims against itself,   sinking like a stone beneath its own waves,   I remember:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cats were once Egyptian gods,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adorned in gold, gifted temples fit for kings    and wonder who I am   to steal your divinity away.      If it had been you at the shelter instead,   would you have picked me from the box,   all hairless, helpless, human as I am --   such a fragile, fumbling thing?      So many others walked away,   their thumbs turning doorknobs,   even if I'd have loved them to the grave.      And when the shadows whisper   that nothing good could ever last,   I stand at the threshold   of what I dared to call your forever home.      With you at my side, I open it wide,   letting the wind whisper temptation to you:   sunbeams spilling through the door,   grass brushing gentle against your fur.   and bugs buzzing by, all begging you to chase.

Passion,Sad-Nail9681,"A word so often portrayed in a plethora of ways,  To understand it comes nothing but a faded gaze;  For it is a fire that burns so wildly through the trees,   Untamed, unhinged, undoubtedly a release;  No one can comprehend what your mind defines of this feeling, whirling around blindly-surely your brain is reeling;  Try and make sense of an emotion so strong…is that how to put it? or could it be wrong ?  This idea can be anything to you, so true a notion has never been more clear,  Your soul a vessel and passion to steer  In a perfect world we’d know just what to do,   But for now my inner light shines brightest when I’m around you.    https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/s/fYN2RjTEEY  https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/s/ykg7VunRQd"
Past makes perfect,Sad-Nail9681,"One day at a time is how you can take it, life that is, for there is no other experience that can fake it.  We take for granted almost every little thing around, squandering the moments that were there, like being homeward bound. The loss of loved ones makes these situations more ample, but together inside turmoil is a horrendous example.  Be kind, courageous, and brave through the years, for the future can bring bountiful joyful tears. Each memory sticks in your mind like a needle on the gauge, wavering side to side aggressively as you age.  No matter what this world throws your way, how you remember it makes your opinion sway, you can’t change the past as it is set in stone, so make way of the grief you can’t atone.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/s/fYN2RjTEEY  https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/s/ykg7VunRQd"
Love Letters (Left Unsaid),C-line_k9,"This is a song I wrote a few months ago, finally beginning to record it.     I sit here alone, pen in my hand,   Writing you letters, wishing you’d understand.  Every word spills my heart on the page,   But I’m just a ghost, locked in this cage.  I still see your smile, etched in my mind,   But time won’t heal this love left behind.   Oh, I wish you were here, feel the warmth of your touch,   But these words on the paper just hurt me too much.   With each teardrop falling, I’m losing my fight,  Writing love letters to you every night.   The ring that I keep, a promise unmade,   Reminds me of nights, where our laughter played.   I pour out my soul, all the things left unsaid,   But you're just a memory, can't bring back the dead.  So I’ll write you a love song, though you're far away,   Each letter a wish for another chance to say.   Oh, I wish you were here, feel the warmth of your touch,   But these words on the paper just hurt me too much.   With each teardrop falling, I’m losing my fight,  Writing love letters to you every night.   I’ll fold up my heart, send it off in the breeze,   But deep down I know, you’re the one I can't please.

Taking Control,bcatolson,"I have this reoccurring dream.    I’m looking in the mirror,    And my hands lunge to my teeth.    Pulling them out by the handful,   I’m greeted by a bloody symphony,    Of skin and veins.    Rotten yellow chipped teeth,    One by one I take them all out.    Nothing in my mouth but blood.    Exposed nerve endings take place,   Where crowns once stood,    Fuck does it hurt.    I run my tongue across my gums    I flash myself my sickly new smile.    Almost proud of my destruction.

Every hour we must conduct an autonomous tally of the emotions that rally inside the tomb of our minds known as the Galley. To give yourself to me is an unforeseen territory full of worry twisted and torn like an automobile thrown to a quarry. We know not of the days to come for our future may glisten bright like the sun, we hope, or, turn ruinous, tumultuous like days on the run.

Alive,Sad-Nail9681,"The morning bestows its gentle warmth upon you with a leisurely horizon, illuminating your face with the radiant sunshine. The oppressive silence is pierced by a single melancholic tune of the bluebird. Slowly, your senses awaken, a whisper from the serpentine stream amplifies. A sudden gust of wind whips through the forest like a knife, resting on your supple cheek. Struggling yet eager, you push forward over the morning dew. For it is a new dawn, the ticking clock draws near, yet you know that where you stand, you are alive.     https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/s/OC1oCFCzVQ  https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/s/xYgnTUMdO8"
The Torchbearer,Independent_Memory41," i. The Torchbearer  They said the world was cold and cruel, so he built fire from bone and bark. Not gifted flame, nor handed rule; just bruised hands striking in the dark.   He made his torch from shattered things: old grief, a vow, a threadbare song, lit it with hope that never clings, and dragged its weight alone, headstrong.   He walked through lands where silence ruled, where voices vanished in the frost, and though the world called him a fool, he kept his path. He knew the cost.   ii. The Town of Carried Light  He reached the gates of Story's End, a town of warm and glowing hands. Where every soul, both stranger, friend, held flames passed down in ancient strands.   Their torches shone with steady grace, clean-edged and humming, calm and wise. His blazed too hot, took half the space, a wildfire wrapped in stormy skies.   They watched him with a quiet awe, not fear—but something close to grief. They'd heard of him, the boy of raw, who carved his torch from disbelief.   iii. The Dousing Trial  ""To join our fire, you must be still. Unlearn the heat that scorched your way."" He laughed. “I forged this from my will. It won’t go out to make you stay.”   But one girl spoke, her torch dimmed low, ""I burned too fast once, just like you."" And in her voice, he felt the snow of nights he nearly didn’t push through.   They faced the dousing trial then; to walk the river, torch in hand. His hissed and screamed like wounded men, but didn’t die. It learned to stand.    iv. The Forge and Flame  He didn’t change to fit their mold. They didn’t ask him to, in time. Instead, he taught the ones grown old how chaos, too, can be sublime.   He stayed a storm wrapped in a smile, a poet-warrior, scarred and true. His fire danced in feral style, but burned a path for others too.   Now when the lost come stumbling in, half-frozen, voice too numb to pray. They find his torch, wild as sin, and light their own to find their way  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m9lwnh/fuck_you_jamie_from_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m9m2ve/hangmans_knell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"

Free form Auto-ficitonal Character Study Poem Triptych,Turbulent_Ear_7782,"These are three individual pieces i wrote, feel free to read them as singular free form poems or as a Trilogy.  # Doing Rounds  I'm sitting at the pub, somewhere quieter. It's right after sunset when the sky isn't orange, but it's not quite dark yet. I'm sitting in a “casual but still trying to look cool and I want people to notice me but don't want people to notice that I want them to notice me” way, as you do.  I see her turn a corner, long legs, not super skinny but in a way i love, medium length skirt, cardigan, tank top under it. I notice a hair on her head, i want nothing more than to brush it off her face while she looks into my eyes, my eyes wander down to look at her cleavage “man I'm a fucking creep”, I look down on the ground as if I was scanning up to down in her general direction in case someone had been watching me. I think to myself why anyone would watch me, I don't look particularly good, in fact, I believe I'm quite ugly. I chuckle slightly while a nail is driven in my heart, “why would she look my way” looking at her hurts now, reminds me of how I will never have her or anything like her. I look at my pint, mostly empty with one gulp left. I take it, warm and wheaty, not particularly nice but it's worse to waste beer. As I'm lowering my glass our eyes meet, not even for a quarter second as she's walking by. I feel myself shrink up and a pain in my chest, I immediately look down. Maybe 1 second after she passes as if to confirm my own creepiness I briefly look at her ass. “Pretty good” I thought to myself then looked at my empty pint, “whats wrong with me”.  My friend enters with two pints  He sits down and i take a drink  “Any women?” I say to him to make conversation  “No, not really. You?”  I look back, she's gone.   “Nah me neither”.  # Asshole  I roll over off of her ""that was great”. I feel her hand linger on my chest as she smiles at me “yeah that was fun”  She hands me a bottle of water while I sit up, still naked, sweating like crazy “oh thank you”. “Yeah i remember last time you were here your mouth was really dry”  This comment gives me pause, she’s looking into my eyes as I take a swig of the water. I don't like it.  I get dressed and head for the door, she walks me to the bus stop, she doesn't have to. I'm waiting at the bus stop and she's waiting with me, she doesn't have to. I get on the bus and wave to her, she looks disappointed.  # Going Out  I’m standing under the warmth of the shower, the shower is steamy, glass fogged up, comfortable.  I step out and dry myself, I brush my teeth, fix my hair, take a moment to just look at myself, “whats wrong with me”.  I get dressed, something stylish but still casual, as I do so my phone buzzes “where are we going?” I reply “let's try somewhere new”.  I'm waiting to go back into town, I'm at the bus stop, I am preparing another night sitting in the same chairs, telling the same stories, drinking the same beers.

Missteps in the Mist,zyerhod1,"**Missteps in the Mist**   *by Bryon Slack*  This wind again, howling past my ears   and around me as I remain suspended   in clinging vines, twisting.   They constrict with each breath,   as if to remind me longing   has a body,   and they pull it back.  The torch that had spun   out of my grasp lays   atop stone among wet   leaves, licking tendrils   of flame diminishing   in time with my rising   sense of foreboding.  I followed foxfire through the trees   and missed the pit,   too taken by the chase   of following this thread.  Cold comfort this knowledge   now as I swing as a pendulum.   A hanging bauble for Fate   to flick with an idle finger   as it turns its thoughts   to other    less confined things.  I do not cry out—   the silence may   answer with words   I don't want.  Or worse—   none at all.  Hands that could hold   flame without burning,   now cup to catch   droplets instead.  Not all quests   end with slain   dragons and   hoards of gold.  **Feedback given:**   • [“The First Look”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1manen6/comment/n5g810q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   • [“Desire and Dissonance”](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mamcrt/comment/n5g8xzb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
The Path I Followed Home,theliminalfox,"*(as breathed by the Writhebinder)*  She did not look back.   She didn’t need to.   The path remembered her   and now,   I know her.  Flame in hand,   she moved like a whisper   returned to its source   weightless,   inevitable.  The wind stirred   not behind her,   but beside me,   curling round my ankles   like a summons.  The trees   tilted their crowns   as I passed.   Not in warning,   in welcome.   Each one bowed   in quiet rhythm,   as if to say:   You are facing the right direction.  The thread pulled,   not sharply,   but with gravity   beneath skin.   Not a command.   A knowing.  I did not call out.   I did not question.   I hummed the old hymns   I did not dare break.  And when I reached the stones   she had stepped across,   they warmed.   Not with fire,   but with recognition   as if they had once   borne my weight,   and had been waiting   to do so again.  The path did not clear.   It parted.   Like something older   was watching   and had just decided:   Let him through.  I did not chase her.   I followed   the imprint   of a flame,   the thread-bound,   that had waited   lifetimes   to be seen.  When I reached the gate   that hadn't existed   until it needed to   I placed my hand,   where hers had been,   and hummed louder.  It opened.  ---  [Feedback 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m9e7xt/comment/n58dv59/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [Feedback 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1ma7v2d/comment/n5fe7ld/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) "

The Velvet Night,Bullll99,"The night unfurls like a velvet curtain, heavy and dark,   A shroud against the world, igniting our spark.   The air hums thick, a heady wine of anticipation,   A stage for us alone, trembling with sensation.    Your skin glows caramel, a silken map to roam,   Warm beneath my fingers, a hearth, a home.   The curve of your hips sings a siren’s refrain,   While your eyes—deep wells—pull me in again.    Shadows cloak the room, save the moon’s pale gleam,   Silver tracing your form, a living dream.   Jasmine weaves through the air, a sultry tease,   Blending with your scent—wild, raw, a breeze.    My heart thuds primal, a drumbeat’s call,   As I step closer, pinned by your thrall.   Your breath hitches soft, a gasp so slight,   When my hands find your skin in the hush of night.    ### The Dance Begins    I trace your jaw’s edge, a sculptor’s line,   Down the slope of your neck, tender, divine.   Your lips bloom open, ripe with heat,   A nectar-sweet kiss where our hungers meet.    Tongues clash and curl, a symphony’s rise,   A crescendo of want beneath moonlit skies.   Your nails carve my back, a feral plea,   Stripping our barriers, setting us free.    Clothes drift away, like leaves in fall,   Unveiling your beauty, answering my call.   Your breasts rise proud, soft peaks to claim,   I cradle their weight, whispering your name.    Nipples tauten, eager for my care,   I bend to taste them, lingering there.   Your moans spill forth, a melody’s thread,   As I tease and suckle, your pleasure fed.    ### Descent into Bliss    Kisses trail lower, a pilgrim’s quest,   Across your stomach, trembling, blessed.   To the cradle of your thighs I roam,   Where desire blossoms, a sacred home.    A flower unfurls, petals slick with dew,   Your musk fills me—earthy, true.   My tongue maps circles, a tender art,   Diving into your core, your beating heart.    Your hips surge wild, chasing my pace,   I feast and linger, lost in your grace.   Your cries pierce the dark, sharp and sweet,   Teetering on the edge, where ecstasy meets.    I pull you back, then push once more,   Teasing the brink, a game to adore.   Until you plead, voice raw with need,   And I grant release—a shattering creed.    You break apart, a storm’s delight,   Waves of rapture flooding the night.   Your body quakes, a vision so rare,   I watch, enthralled, as you float there.    ### Union and Fire    Yet the dance endures, our tale unwinds,   I rise to join you, our fates aligned.   At your threshold I pause, slick and bold,   Then thrust within, a story told.    You gasp at the fullness, the searing flame,   Our bodies meld, no space, no shame.   We sway as one, a timeless beat,   Each motion a vow where our souls meet.    Your legs lock tight, drawing me in,   Sweat beads and blends, skin on skin.   Faster we climb, a fevered race,   Nails rake my flesh, marking your place.    The summit nears, a roaring tide,   We chase it fierce, side by side.   You clench around me, a pulsing grip,   I spill within, a boundless slip.    ### Afterglow and Renewal    We collapse entwined, breathless, spent,   A tangle of limbs, our energies lent.   The silence hums with our fading sighs,   Basking in the glow where passion lies.    But embers flicker, desire reborn,   With you, my love, I’m never forlorn.   Again we stir, a fresh verse to weave,   In this endless tale we both believe.    Through the night we roam, wild and free,   From tender touch to fierce decree.   Your body’s my shrine, my endless muse,   A fire we stoke, never to lose.    ### Dawn’s Embrace    As dawn streaks gold across the sky,   We drift to sleep, you and I.   Yet dreams still burn with vivid hue,   For my heart, my soul, belong to you.    When sunlight spills, we’ll rise once more,   To chase the flames we can’t ignore.   Our love’s a blaze, eternal, vast,   A poem of passion, forever cast.    ---   This is our song, our vivid art,   A testament to the fire in our heart.   For as long as we live, as long as we breathe,   This desire, this love, we’ll never leave.  ---  *This is an original poem. Feedback is welcome!

"How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 5",zyerhod1,"**How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 5**   *(The Heroes)*   by Bryon Slack  We did not just kill them.   We mapped the routes,   paid the fares,   and tied the noose   and hid the daggers   before calling it a tragedy.  **Martin Luther King.**   Not the sanitized monument we offer now—   but the man who warned us   that America might go to hell.   The man who stood against war,   against greed, against Power,   against the polite indifference of the white moderate.   That capitalism was doomed to rot.   He died on a motel balcony   in Memphis,   after marching with garbage workers   to remind us that even poverty   has dignity, that the poor are, indeed,   still human.  **Malcolm X.**   Sharp-tongued prophet   of fire and self-respect.   We like to quote him now—   after he was shot.   After he softened,   after he started asking questions   that couldn’t be dismissed with fear.   He died before he turned 40,   standing in front of Black children   with Truth in his mouth   and bullets in his chest.  **Fred Hampton.**   Twenty-one years old.   Charisma carved from conviction.   He built rainbows of Hope   from the bones of broken movements—   Black, white, Puerto Rican,   southern, northern, rural, urban...   even some of us that openly hated them—   and that made him lethal   to the men who fear unity.   So we drugged him in his sleep   and put nine bullets in his body   where it lay next to his pregnant wife   before he woke up.  **COINTELPRO** was not a shadow.   It was a mirror.   We paid for it.   We built it and made it a doctrine—   That Black anger must be defanged,   that Black Hope must be redirected,   that Black leaders must be discredited   or destroyed.  We tapped phones and forged letters.   We sowed distrust and fear   until movements split like overripe fruit   under the pressure of our ever   watchful eyes.  We didn't just fear violence.   Old men with money feared organization.   Old men with money feared truth told with clarity.   Old men with money feared love spoken in solidarity.  And now, we remember them   in murals   and postage stamps   and hashtags.  But we don’t remember the plans.   The memos or the lies.  We say “Never again”   even though we're   the ones that did it that time,   and every time after.  And then we teach our children   that King was a dreamer,   Malcolm was too angry,   Fred was too young to matter,   and the FBI was just doing its job.  But the job was to keep them quiet at any cost.   And the quiet cost blood.  We called it security.   We called it patriotism.   We called it necessary.  But it was murder.   It was assassination.   And it worked.  Until it didn’t.   Until their words   kept echoing   long after we buried them.  **Feedback:**   [""After Seventeen""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mac6bv/comment/n5fco1r/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""Boarded Up Boredom""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1ma1jgd/comment/n5fdu9i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Undisclosed Address,patrickb1920,"A broken flow of my footsteps by the loosely laid limbs, languishing on the floor. The gangway wide and tall, but filled with bodies lined up – feral cats deep in slumber.   The wisp of smoke flowed down the dark corridor; stretching, illuminated with dimly lit neon blues, whites, and aquatic hues.   Lights silently hum to the deep dull thump of the brooding bass; like a thumping heartbeat heard in the silence of a safe waiting to be cracked; deep under pressure – a stethoscope to your chest with every movement heard.   A shimmer as the neon lights shined on the pitch blackness of the ice cold walls. Such a large irony to the heat of the bodies, burning up in the mix of androgynous swelter, bodies laying down like worn out slaves.   \---   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1maha07/a\_poem\_i\_wrote\_in\_a\_bout\_of\_selfhatred/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1maha07/a_poem_i_wrote_in_a_bout_of_selfhatred/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1maawph/mind\_me/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1maawph/mind_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

After Seventeen,ghostpoett,"i expected the world to stay dark—   to keep echoing like it did   when i buried everything i was.  i didn’t think joy still knew my name.   not after everything.  i used to think   joy had to be earned.   that i needed to become better,   more stable,   more fixed   before i deserved softness again.  maybe that’s why i almost missed it—   i didn’t believe anything gentle   would come back for me.  but then something shifted—   not all at once,   not in a way i could explain.   just one of those days   where the air didn’t feel as heavy.   where silence didn’t hum with guilt.   where i caught myself breathing   without trying so hard to.  i didn’t trust it at first.   i thought it was memory,   or some trick my mind pulled   to keep me from breaking again.   i looked around the room   and waited for it to pass—   but it didn’t.  no warning.   no crescendo.   just a moment   that didn’t ache.   a quiet so soft   it felt like forgiveness.  even though this happiness doesn’t stay forever,   it still leaves its warmth behind—   like the fading hum after a song,   or smoke curling in the air   after fireworks burst and vanish.   you don’t always notice it return.   sometimes it slips in quietly,   without asking if you’re ready.  but one thing i’ve learned—   it always finds its way back.   not always loud,   not always long,   but always enough   to remind you it’s still out there—   returning in different forms,   in different faces,   in the quietest places.  my happiness returned   in the sound of small feet   running through my house.   in surprise visits   and soft arms around my neck.   in voices i hadn’t heard in months—   laughing like no time had been lost.   no big announcement.   just love, walking in like it had the key.  and no,   it didn’t fix everything.   it didn’t erase what i buried.   but it cracked the silence.   it let the light in.   enough to remind me—   i’m still here.   i’m still capable   of feeling something good.  because even joy   has a way of remembering the way back home.  feedback:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ro2u/comment/n4fz6z6/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ro2u/comment/n4fz6z6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mabqlu/comment/n5dhr65/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mabqlu/comment/n5dhr65/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Underwater,byJohar,"Bound at wrist and ankle tight,   Tossed below, you gasp for light.   A fanged shark glides near and sweet—   “Come to tea,” it hums beneath.   You slip the knots but cannot swim;   Each flailing limb draws wrath from them.   They seize and bend, waves pull you in—   You drift alone, too far for kin.   Old ghosts and silence split the sea.   In chilled descent, you cease to plea.   From reddish-blues to black you fade,   Your throat’s gone raw, your thoughts half-made.   You learn the reapers' lullaby,   And teach yourself to tread, not die.   You mostly choose the dark below,   But one night rise and start to go.   They greet you then with stunned delight:   “You should have called! You should have hollered!”   You blink, your voice a famine dry—   *I did,* you think, *but I was underwater.*    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/cq5mqOiHIZ  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/an0vLW2IOS"

Still life,Top-Air461,"The world keeps spinning, fast and wide, But some of us stand still inside. A clock keeps ticking, sharp and loud, Yet silence gathers in the crowd.  They ask, ""You good?"" and walk away, Not waiting for what you might say. You smile — it’s cheaper than the truth, And lies wear better than lost youth.  You laugh in text, in caps and cries, But pixels can’t hold real goodbyes. A thousand friends, a hundred chats, But none who notice deeper cracks.  The day scrolls by in endless loops, Like distant trains or dusty soups. Your coffee cools, untouched again, Another post, another ""when?""  They say you’re strong, you’re always fine — A well-worn mask, a practiced line. But strength, too, tires, and glass can break, Even the calmest heart can ache.  There’s mourning in what no one sees, A grief that hides in daily ease. Not all who cry will make a sound, Not all the lost are underground.  We walk in crowds yet feel unseen, Ghosts dressed in denim, blue and clean. We ache for touch, for truth, for care, But fear the cost of laying bare.  So if you pass someone today, And don’t know what you ought to say — Try “Hey,” but mean it, stay awhile. You might just spark a needed smile.

I recently found a trilogy of poems I wrote over seven years ago in my notes app. I don’t remember writing them all that well. I’m 21 now but here they are. I’d love to hear what people think of them.,Heavy-Loss-7297,"Bloom, Wither, Rest  A collection of poems written by Austin Grosso   I. Watch Through My Waking Sight  I ponder upon what once was good, Doubting it then in my young boyhood. Ere it heard my soul and brought the spell By that dear name whom I could not dwell.  I wandered the stream that grew ever bright. Dark was that night with no beauty. Behind a wound I stood and held thee, Kept soft watch through my waking sight.  Clear the dim light in the burning sky. Since that dear time when dark thoughts ran, My eye on life is left undone. How can I see thee, if I die?  Strangely we see, amid that dim year, If hope could save from that dimmest hour, Before thy side the bright white flower Without thy power had drawn you near!  Read thy radiant walls of decay Almost like thy watch to our sleep? Already the seraph harpers weep Before thy memories withered away.   II. The Hollow Where You Bloomed  No flower stirs where once you lay The white has grayed. The scent, decayed. I kneel in earth grown rough with years And feed the dust with nameless tears.  I do not call, for none would hear; Your name now stings the silent air. The wind remembers how you’d sing A ghost in every greening spring.  The walls of thought have split and dried. The wound remains. The soul has died. Yet still I haunt the path we knew, Not seeking you just what was true.  And if some light should pass me by, A glint of gold in ashen sky, I’ll smile once for the love I knew  Not to forget, but to walk through.    III. A Place to Lay the Flowers  I bring no prayer, no tear to shed, Just lilies for the life you led. The trees don’t whisper like before, The ache has settled in the floor. No ghost to chase, no steps to trace Just silence in a sacred place.  Your name is quiet on my tongue, A song half-formed, but gently sung. Not sharp with ache, not raw with fire Just breath and time and small desire To see you now not as the pain, But as the warmth behind the rain.  I lay the flowers down with care, And leave the rest still blooming there. No need for words, nor final line You live on in all I’ve known. And when I walk, I do not cry, But pause once, watching swallows fly.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Qf8ZuDg4BT  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/4z4wvxV4uS  "
The Love You’ll Never Know,Top-Air461,"I love you, though you’ll never see, The way you mean the world to me. I speak no words, I make no claim, Yet every thought recalls your name.  I watch you laugh, I hear you speak, I feel my silence start to leak. A thousand things I’d like to say But fear would only drive you away.  So here I stay, just out of sight, A shadow dancing with the light. You live your life, you smile, you shine, Unknowing that your joy is mine.  I wish you’d turn and see me there, Not out of need-but just to care. Yet even if you never do, I’ll still be here, just loving you.  No promises, no hope to keep, Just dreams I visit when I sleep. And though you’ll never truly know, I loved you once, and love you so.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7zH3oqkgbt  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/4kYJltqC62 "

Like I thought she’d stay       just because it was real.        She smiled like trouble       and I didn’t care.       I wrote her into every version of my recovery.       She read none of them.        I kept calling it love       because naming it anything else       felt like losing again.        I got better.       Or maybe I just stopped showing symptoms.        My best friend left       right when I remembered who I was.       Told me nothing.       Like I was a phase       she finally shook off.        I don’t cry.       Not because I don’t want to    because the tears don’t believe me anymore.        Two years of silence.       Two years of playing stable       so people wouldn’t panic.       So I could still sit at the table       like I hadn’t       I used to beg for feelings.       Now I flinch when I get them.        I’m healing.       But the scar tissue’s loud.

I am the sun and he is the moon.,Interesting-One7399,"I am the sun and he is the moon. We give and take, at times he needs my light to stay grounded, other times I need his darkness to soften the harsh burn of the light that burns so intensely. It all flows out destroying everything in its path carelessly. The darkness is not perfect either, the moon has secrets. It lies as its glowing. The glow is dangerous, it blinds you as its sparkling in your eyes putting you in a trance. You see its beauty and its pain yet you love it all the same because without it what would keep you from melting? Showing the world behind the bright beautiful wall that youve created just to keep them from seeing the hot unforgiving fire just behind the mask? The moon is sneaky, it hits you when you least expect it and tries to find excuses as to why it feels the need to dim your light. You let it go because nobody ever looked at the sun the way the moon did, embracing the heat and the exhaustion, the trauma and the scars. The moon loves the sun but is the moon in love with the sun? The moon loves to look at the stars, they are more like him. Beautiful and bright, easy to look at. The sun is hard to love too bright, hot to the touch, quick tempered, something is always going on with the sun but moon is a distractor, in other words avoidant. “If we dont talk about our problems they wont be there.” They are always there for the sun never forgotten. They are evolving, changing in different directions onto different paths and yet the sun cant let go of the moon, the moon holds on slightly and tangles the sun until it cant move. The moon suffocating the life from the sun with its hold. As the suns light dims she is less herself than she has ever been before, dim, dark, cold. The sun is cold.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/gmBoGMLmP7  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/lQ8LtdsdQp"
The Devil Retold,Seriously_Lost_Poet,"Your worship is a crime,          I know.          Then why am I          So tempted to grow -         A garden off your silent power         Inhale the scent         Of a wilted flower.                   You scream fire         And watch your wings rust.          Your burning rage         Turns its feather to dust.          Ruthless vengeance,          Mercy for no other -         Such is the ache          Of an absent Father.                   The angels speak your tongue.         Their sins take cover     Behind your fiery color.     Let heaven      fall heavy with the knowledge -     That when existence reaches     Its very edge -     In its foretold end,      Their God won't listen     Only you could be their friend.                    Explanation: This is a piece on the casting out of Lucifer, God’s son and one of the archangels, and being named as the “Devil”. It explores the narrator’s feeling towards lucifer as a misunderstood being and how he is basically a scapegoat as he’s held responsible for all evil in the universe and how in the apocalyptic end God may abandon us just like he did lucifer.  I understand this may be a very sensitive topic so if this triggers/ hurts anyone I apologise sincerely, but please don’t hate because of difference in ideas. Please give constructive criticism on how I can improve, thoughts on your interpretation and if the message is clear thru the poem!  This is my second piece here. If you like it here’s the link to my previous work which deals with the personification of life and death with example of a human who believes failure is the end.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/klt2wvFr3A  Your feedback or upvote on both of these will be really appreciated.

You came walking   not towards me   but beside the memory   of something you used to guard.      You didn’t speak.   But the trees bowed   like they knew you,   and the stars hummed   a familiar ache   in your bones.      I didn’t call out.   I didn’t need to.   The dream was already   mid-sentence,   and our steps   were the rest of the line.      You paused at the bridge.   Touched the rail like it had once carried your weight.   Then looked back   not at me,   but at the place   you used to return from.      You walked in the distance,   torch in one hand,   lighting the path.   The thread pulls.

Pen Sieve,zyerhod1,"**Pen Sieve**   *by Bryon Slack*  Pensive, I sit as I sieve   with my pen—   words that fall from my mind   and the tracing of old hurts.  Some drip slow, like nearly closed wounds,   thick with ache and fresh memory.   Others rattle loose—   sharp, unclean,   newly fresh   in their aged fermentation—   shards I thought long buried beneath.  My inkwell is filled   with what’s dug from   beneath root and topsoil,   dumped into the agitated   troughs in the tracks   of my recollection.  I sift them gently   with the tip of my quill—   gold from grit and old suffering—   probing what’s caught   for nuggets of still-held truths.  A Truth in fragments,   a voice once lost,   sluiced in sorrow,   panned from pain,   from old scars   covered in frost.  I draw the ink   of these distilled sorrows   in the outline of beauty—   on the page pinned   beneath my gaze and off hand.

Drown – (i want feedback),No-Strain9095," A sea of thoughts in that which we commune, like soft whispers at night, or warm kisses when blue. A sea pthat we drown in, not that we swim in. To dream in, or breathe in, with each other in view.  We feel not to talk small, or to talk words at all, but to sink in, and think in— never to wade in. The water’s made of love that we bathe in, always perfectly warm—never near scathing.  Intertwining our fingers in silent embrace, the smell of the ocean gives nothing but taste. Slow burn. Let the candle drip. My eyes drink in the tender flame of your face. Naked bodies trace the waltz. No haste. Our bare silhouettes together, alone in the depths. A ripple of water that makes not even a sound brings warmth to my heart, like red flame curling the mouth. It lances gracefully in all directions, expanding out, touching every corner of our sea. Every breath you take completely entrances me.  Cold rain drums against my back. I shiver. Standing aimlessly on this beach, I gaze out at this familiar deep river. I raise my hand, stretch out to reach. My fingertips crave the water’s comfort— one touch to ignite all its memories. My heart screams so loud I cannot ignore its hurt. I freeze—rain trails like veins down my spine. My body yearns for that beautiful blue, but the water is tainted forever by you.  I lay flat. Feel the sand on my skin. Existing mindlessly— empty space. Stars patter the landscape. Perpetual lack of emotion. Scattered thoughts. Broken. Yet I welcome that familiar notion— the only thing I’ve known.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/2FpDhu1xJW  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ifve9jvpXa"

The tectonic pressure  of half truths that tried to surface  but cooled too quickly.  Returned to the depths.  When it did come,  it did not arrive magmatic.  Its layers folded,  heated,  compressed.  Your histories buckling.  Common minerals migrating,  finding each other,  crystallizing.  Then,  like the first time,  You didn’t break through,  you breached.  Gasping.  Eyes open.  A new lattice formed.  Microscopic.  atomic.  Stable when cracked.  Fractured to a new whole.  And then,  rising,  convecting,  the spring finding light,  joining the river’s flow.  No more the thinker.  But the crossing.  The confluence.

Torchbearer,Independent_Memory41,"i. The Torchbearer  They said the world was cold and cruel, so he built fire from bone and bark. Not gifted flame, nor handed rule; just bruised hands striking in the dark.   He made his torch from shattered things: old grief, a vow, a threadbare song, lit it with hope that never clings, and dragged its weight alone, headstrong.   He walked through lands where silence ruled, where voices vanished in the frost, and though the world called him a fool, he kept his path. He knew the cost.   ii. The Town of Carried Light  He reached the gates of Story's End, a town of warm and glowing hands. Where every soul, both stranger, friend, held flames passed down in ancient strands.   Their torches shone with steady grace, clean-edged and humming, calm and wise. His blazed too hot, took half the space, a wildfire wrapped in stormy skies.   They watched him with a quiet awe, not fear—but something close to grief. They'd heard of him, the boy of raw, who carved his torch from disbelief.   iii. The Dousing Trial  ""To join our fire, you must be still. Unlearn the heat that scorched your way."" He laughed. “I forged this from my will. It won’t go out to make you stay.”   But one girl spoke, her torch dimmed low, ""I burned too fast once, just like you."" And in her voice, he felt the snow of nights he nearly didn’t push through.   They faced the dousing trial then; to walk the river, torch in hand. His hissed and screamed like wounded men, but didn’t die. It learned to stand.    iv. The Forge and Flame  He didn’t change to fit their mold. They didn’t ask him to, in time. Instead, he taught the ones grown old how chaos, too, can be sublime.   He stayed a storm wrapped in a smile, a poet-warrior, scarred and true. His fire danced in feral style, but burned a path for others too.   Now when the lost come stumbling in, half-frozen, voice too numb to pray. They find his torch, wild as sin, and light their own to find their way  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m9lwnh/fuck_you_jamie_from_work/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m9m2ve/hangmans_knell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"

Pink little Egg,Independent_Memory41,"  I think about the little things. How something small: a laugh, a look, the way your hands fidgeted when nervous; burns brighter than the fireworks we swore would mark our start.   I think about the patch you kept playing with, worn soft from my skin, how it became your stress ball, your comfort. Something ordinary that somehow mattered.    I think about how you cried when I showed up. Not from sadness, but from the fragile weight of being seen and not knowing if you deserved it.    I remember your stories, about broken places and stitched up years, your friends who saved you, the mentor who understood.  I listened like the answers to loving you were buried between your pauses.   You thought you looked like a mess. I saw something blooming.   There was this night. You were spiraling. Doubting. Trying to outrun your own history. So I grabbed your hand and ran. Not away...just... to somewhere lighter. Until laughter knocked the panic out of you. Until you looked alive again.    I told you I loved you. And maybe that was the moment you left. Not with your feet, but with your fear.   Maybe love, no matter how soft I spoke it, sounded like a trap. Maybe every “I’m here” echoed like “You’re stuck.”    I didn’t know how to love you without reminding you of what you ran from. I tried to be shelter.  But maybe all you saw was another storm waiting to break.    I remember the hospital. The way humor became the only way I could talk without breaking down. I remember feeling like I had failed you already, even while holding your hand.    I thought we were solid. So I stopped checking the foundation. Thought I was giving you everything, but maybe it came in the wrong shape, wrapped in mold instead of light.    And yet...  I still see you.    Not just the good. Not just the brave. But the messy, the wrecked, the trembling.  And I love you for it. I always will.    There’s this image that won't let me go; a tree healing around a wound. People say it’s like a nail. But you weren’t a nail.    You were a pink egg with tiny angel wings, folded gently into the bark.  Not pain. Just permanence.   Even if nothing blooms here again, I’ll carry that shape forever.   The way your eyes dimmed and lit up. The way your silence said everything you couldn’t bear to say out loud.    If I ever find something that echoes you...  God help me.  Because beauty like that doesn’t come without grief.    And if these are my final words,  if this is all that remains,  I hope the world gives you peace. I hope you smile more than you flinch. I hope someone listens to your silences and doesn’t ask you to explain.    And if it takes ten more years for your voice to reach mine again, I’ll still be listening.    Because I know now.. you were worth the wait.

No songs are sung, no hearts are sworn, No yearning eyes, no pages worn. You’re always fine, you're never more— A welcome mat, not love nor lore.

Did you ever look at me that way?,Pixels_o,"You bent down slow, as if afraid to make it go, to startle something soft and true the room fell quiet around you.  Your eyes were caught, they didn’t stray, drawn to the baby, pale and gray with brand new skin and breath so light as if she glowed beneath the light.  And something changed within your stance, your shoulders dropped, as if by chance. Your brow unknit, your silence stirred, and that without speaking a single word  You looked at her, so small, so still, a weightless thing that bent your will. And in that gaze, so strangely free for the first time i think,  I saw you see.  You smiled. Not the smirk you wear with style, No, this smile stayed a little while. It trembled, small and shy and true, a quiet thing that slipped right through.  Your eyes grew wide, no longer blocked, like windows you forgot you’d locked. Soft, as if the world was kind, as if regret had never lined the edges of your steady hands, like wonder still obeyed commands.  There was no joke, no guard, no game, just you and something hard to name. A marvel settled on your face, slow and warm, like time gave grace.  And I, I wasn’t watching her at all. Not her tiny fists or body small.  I stared at you, just to the side, my breath caught low, nowhere to hide. Because I’d never seen you wear a look so open, unaware. And try as I might to look away, my heart refused. It chose to stay.  A question rose, both sharp and warm, a hush before an unseen storm. It caught my throat, it pulled me tight, a truth I wasn’t there to write:   Did you ever look at me that way, in some soft, unspoken yesterday? With eyes so wide and full of grace, as if I was your sacred place?  When I was small enough to hold, before your warmth grew quiet, cold, before love turned to nods and space, and jokes that time could not replace.  I tried to picture it, your face above mine, newborn and blinking, Reflecting your eyes,  But the image doesn’t come. No flicker, no frame, just a hollow space where love never came.  So I stood there, body tight and drawn, like something inside me had just been torn.  Shoulders stiff, and eyes cast low, wearing a calm I didn’t quite know.  My chest was aching, my hands stayed still, grieving a gap no moment could fill.  A memory lost before it could start, yet somehow alive in the bones of my heart.  A quiet sorrow I couldn’t explain, mourning a softness I never could name.  —  1) https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/I3iQHWQ8q3  2) https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/BGJYUQVBD3"

Regret,Plenty_Mistake_9577,"At the end of the road, what will your regret be ?     Not beleiving the dream before it turned to smoke,   Not holding the person before they let you go.  The Silence that ruined more than words ever could,  Or leaving the ones you knew you never should.   .  You tell me yours and i'll tell you mine-   My biggest regret would be -   If someday I lost my ability to feel,   To hold someone's hand, sit in silence and heal.   To question reality if it's the truth or deceit,   To see what's hidden beneath the silent sea.   Then I would lose a gift that truly defined me.   .  If I put myself in a box and shut myself in,  Turned blind to cracked walls, worn sheds and stories within.  If I forgot when to show up or let alone why,   If I stopped listening to the symphonises playing in my mind.   Would I still be a human or some insect, unaware if I am alive ?   .  Cause without it my life wouldn't be dark - it would  be bleak.  Like a white wall still there, still standing but barely seen.   Like a tasteless fruit, a tree with no shadow, a house no one lived in.   .  You see -   I want to understand the world before it speaks,  Feel it's breathe before the silence creeps.   listen, until echoes sound like thunder to me.   I want to study till I can put it together piece by piece.    Feedback -  1. https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/1AH6Hi8WqB 2. https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/cEsCqnhihv"
The Mountain,GoodGuy_Hamza,"Far in the distance, Under the dead of night, I see the mountain come alive Its cold breath felt far and wide, Its all-encompassing gaze Piercing mist and darkness alike  Far in the distance, I see the heavens in respite, Cradled by the mountain. I see stars in arrested flight, Burning like fireflies, With smouldering light.

A Moment Of Truth,Seriously_Lost_Poet,"You feel her when you         Fall to the earth         And let your face         Be smeared with dirt.        You can hear her         Laugh - aloud in mirth                  ""Why do you laugh"" -   You always ask         She picks you up,         Takes off her mask,         And you see her once,         In all her glory,       And realize -     In all of her stories,   she was always gory .                  So you look her in the eye.        She says, ""Do you feel alive?         When every time you fail         Blood still runs -         Warm in your veins.""

Spooking The Nuthatch,Sinsecurity,I read the pitching echoed prose  Throughout the elder sylvan rows  From far below what spoke it  In autumn’s aspen flecks of gold—  She and I  To the Hatch was told—  From us to a mutual ear   Words that weren’t whispered here—  To interrupt the song or call or mourn  That would just make the heart run—  And in the space of four eyes on one  The song was sung  That memory made  From the pretty bird aloft—  And we watched the Hatch fly off.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/tHSEpj9iZ6 https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/BsUJbsxREE
I Grew Warmer When,Sinsecurity,"I loved those dark brown eyes of yours,  My morning coffee  Black—  And how we stared at each other  Smiling, saying “what?”  Back and forth without actually  Knowing the question.  How the ice melted in my drink  In a short-lived sepia eye,  You finally grew cold,  When I was warm to cry,  You really could know what, my love  But I never  Ever knew why.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/tHSEpj9iZ6  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/BsUJbsxREE"
"Angelika, Lover…",Sinsecurity,"I wrote you a letter again:  Maybe to ask how your day had been, or really to show you just how blue these eyes have gotten since you stared last. When you could make me feel awake again with just a word or two. How I loved! How I wish I could just know everything now. How much less could I be before you see the line where I was? If I wrote you all that I could, would it even reach you? Could you understand how many tears made my sheets too gross to sleep in… to the point where I just have to say this… even if I put it right in front of you? You could know! I wish I could just tell you everything now. How much more of me could I give before you see what I am at the center?   I wrote you a poem again:  Not that you ever liked them —but no I don’t exaggerate— maybe there was a care but not an introspective moment —to come too late—that I had aimed for, ever stuck to your heart the way I yearned to. The only way I wanted to make you cry was out of an overwhelming beauty because any word I wrote couldn’t be as beautiful as its product… your single tear. Even when you cried over some silly show, it was somehow so pure from the soft voice I hear. The emotion… the only thing that’s real. The same as how you made me feel. Some nights I dream you back in my life. When the morning comes I remember why I tucked you away. I can turn your beauty to song, but I can’t make you love me by day.   I wrote you a song again:  Music just like our first night together. Singing the way I swore I heard an angel do when our lips first touched. Its chords are gorgeous and bittersweet with a nuanced rhythm and flow. That’s why it makes me think of you. The ending is unsteady, abrupt, and makes me tear up every time I replay that grand exit just in my mind. That is why it makes me think of us. My lyrics are supposed to be thoughtful but I guess I was too drunk to think about it again. That is why it makes me think of death.  I wrote you a suicide note:  Because I had nothing left to say—           https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7VZK0NTswI https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/lEVj80PJZh"

Oh! Oh! One day, No more pain, No oceans of grief, No more regrets, Or even tears.   Oh! Oh! One day, May I return to it — My nostalgic dream.   Oh! Oh! One day, No drugs, no cries In my sleep.   No shouts at me, And no unfair judgments Like hurricanes Over a ship – In the midst of sea – With a broken sail.   I dream one day, No pain, nor being numb; Like a paralyzing nightmare, Where you cannot even Hear your screams.   I imagine wings With no bleed.   I re-imagine them With feathers like a daisy lily, Not like scarlet wine splattered Upon a bride’s gown; Not like pearl silk soaked in blood.   Oh! I dreamed, I wished In my imagination — I transform.   Nothing to stop me, I am light.   In reality, my light no more ignites, No more wishes of no pain; As darkness always devours My baby-blue lights, Like a black-hole lion Stalking his deer stars.              ●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●◇●       ■ A note: If you'd like to read another piece of mine, here's my previous poem:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/uVrb5uFbGf  I will be so glad to have your feedback 😊 "
Disillusionment,WildJackJack,"Had anticipation on occasion as an adolescent. Callow enough to think financial freedom would bestow me. Wide-eyed unsophisticated monkey, hanging on bars like nothing could stop me. How naive, this isn't the suite life no matter what I thought it'd be. Figured by 21 I'd be the Chuck bass of the century, jokes on me, down and out not broke but suffering. I really wonder what it'd be like to live like Oprah Winfrey. Bet she never stresses about the bills, outstanding; I managed to put myself into debt without intending. Hounded, I followed what society told me, not that I couldn't achieve, I blame economy shifting so high everyone I know, it's misery. Figured by this time we'd all be magical, poof Houdini. If I made as much money as I do now, maybe 2015. I'd have the same amount of freedom as Forbes Listed, not hated by those beneath me. I'd treat everyone equally, we're all the same desiring okay, when's my turn to be blessed with simplicity? Property wage and wealth enough so I don't burn myself out before the age of fifty. Grey hairs sprouting like daylilies, you'd think devil wears Prada, mamma mia! When you see - you'll be asking, who is she?  The same millennial who's tired,  Vexing to work your ass off with nothing but complaining, can you blame me?  Generality all carbon copies, No time line specifics just irritable, thirsty. On pins and needles just waiting for death to dive in and take me. But that's just morbid, sue me. Can't help that I have a hankering to close the curtains, cease the downbeat. Melancholy is my ordinary,  You'd agree, you probably do.  We're interchangeable, relatable when it comes to, living shouldn't be like swallowing buckleys, even with the amount of venom spewed, living isn't like the flu. We're all zombies by the time we're thirty two. But I'll keep praying to the God's I exclude, what else can I do?  Jokes on me, I'm already out of ones misery just floating through.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m7hsgf/comment/n54crq2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m951mk/comment/n54dqal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button  "
What Do We All See?,ToneOwn888,"All I see? Gaggles of humans laced with potential to build and/or destroy.  Often times, building’s done solo. Destruction’s executed in convoy.  All I see? Affirmations lost by people, found in places & things.  Often times, making gods of possessions possesses clipped wings.  All I see? A society of empty souls seeking fulfillment only they can own.  Often times, the masses fail to realize what they seek’s outside of their phone(s).  All I see? A full deck of Kings reduced to their Richards & their “modest” size.  Often times, those sentiments change as C-notes wave before zealous eyes.  All I see? Dens filled with lionesses mourning their lost cubs.  Often times, the cords of Camaraderie snap as awaited newborns enter bathtubs.  All I see? Me observing this behavior, knowing that I’m no better.  Often times, dreams of becoming change I want to see only come true if I get it together.  So tell me, what do you all see? Don’t be afraid to speak your truth.

Homesick,jvstblueskies,"Can you guess what my current obsession is?          &nbsp;   *On finishing another year of university, leaving a lover behind, and going abroad.*  &nbsp;              I made a home of libraries and peers.    Ephemeral home, washed in July’s dusk,      Ithaca past, my Odyssey present.  Returning, homesick for this borrowed life    Your laughter softened evenings into dawn,   Your touch—*electric*, edged with Eros’ fire            Penelope in faith; Athena near,  You calmed the waves drowning promising thoughts,      Seas of anguish and despair, sent not by            Poseidon, but the dread of going “home.”   &nbsp;   I am back and already sick of “home.”     Blank walls still stare, but do not know my face         Mirrors hang, having forgotten my gaze.    This house is not my Ithaca. Crumbling,         Cramped, caged. Safest when unseen by kinsmen.     The flies feel safe whilst I am left to rot.    The gods that favoured me have left me bare.    I stand unarmed where once I played the part.     O Athena, grace me with your presence              I yearn for your voice: digital, divine.    &nbsp;   You were Calypso (not to bind or claim),   A soft escape, a shelter in the storm.    You stocked my raft with love and watched me leave,   No curses cast, no pleas to stay ashore.   With open arms, you let me depart for    A sea of forms, visas, and foreign tongues.    I will return, though duty calls me on.    For now, I dream of one year’s turning tide,     I shall walk the shore where Calypso waits.      Athena’s hand mending a homesick heart,   Penelope will smile with knowing eyes,     And Ithaca....not left, but redefined.     &nbsp;    Thank you for reading until the end!

By naming your shadow,   Writhebinder,   I, in turn   had to name   my own.  I wasn’t just your mirror.   I was mine, too.   And what I saw?   I almost couldn’t bear it.  I feared   illuminating shadows,   holding mirrors   you weren’t ready to see.  I feared   you would run   from the fire   I use to protect   truth   and wield like a blade.  From the stillness   I retreat into   when I ache.   From the part of me   that wants to rest,   not lead.   From the weight   I carry   to stay standing.  My strength is forged   from survival.   But I want   to be held   without   having to ask.  I fear the forgetting   each time the thread hums   and we do not answer the call.   I fear the haunting.   I fear who we become.   I fear remembering less   each cycle.  I gave you reflections,   and my mirror   made me see:   I was the unravelling,   too.  I am your ache   in fire.   You are my ache   in the storm.  Don’t fall   for illusions   I cast about myself.   While I might be flame   flame still longs   for one   to sit beside it.  I seek you   just as   you seek me.  I never ask you   to come whole.   Just come true.   I believe   while I do come whole,   and true   you ask for my shadow,   as well as flame   in return.  A sovereign priestess,   still has shadow   when light is cast   upon her.  And now   I name my shadow   as I have named yours.  So now,   you see.  I remove my mask because   I chose to.  Our fears   mirrored.   Two souls.

Does that sun parch   or does it vivify? Only time will tell, we know that well,   although we also know ourselves, and possibly only that.   But poets sing regardless, knowing that this too shall pass,   that all must pass, but most of all this ratiocentric   obsession with self, with reason, with power, which plagues   this hour with Man so magnified nothing else breaks through.  \--  But what else is there? Only God? And Nature?   We, no longer children, will not take our fairy-tales,   but crave more solid food, the real meat of the matter.   But too bad for us, the stories are the meat,   and always were, and our mancenteredness is only   one more story. C'est la vie.

You’re not sure if even You believe that.  dirty pants, phone chargers, nice shirts worn to impress, watches, shoes, and toiletries,  all accomplices in this lie,  make their way back to where they belong.  at the bottom of your bag your hand grabs something strange,  \-  a pair of day pass pool wristbands,  unused and joined together,   still unworn from your last day in philadelphia.  these wristbands serve no purpose,  they: evidence of a crime, a permanent reminder of what happened,  that for good or for bad, You are not the decent person You always thought You were,  and yet,  \-  You are flooded with memories,  with thoughts, feelings, emotions.  your flight back was purposefully scheduled late, it was the only way to see Him for longer.  You didn’t know or care how You would spend those final hours in philadelphia,  except that they were with Him.  You like the sunshine, the happy, the exciting,   He is thoughtful, He is kind, He gives You what You need.  maybe You told Him what You like,  earlier on in this years-long fling that has existed only for weeks.  or maybe you are so in tune that He knew exactly what You wanted.  \-  You remember the excitement, the apprehension, the anxiety,  walking to the uber in a bathing suit.  more time,  more fun,  more of anything by a pool with Him,  You never wanted anything this bad.  capriciously, your insecure self can’t help but remind You there will be  an end,  a good bye,  a see you later  or see you never.  together you make the plan:   He is dropping his luggage off, from your room shared in sin, back to his apartment,  You will meet Him at the rooftop pool nearby.  \-  You remember the awkwardness,  showing up at the fancy hotel.  You look like the most tourist-coded dad you have ever seen,  but You are confident and composed.  You feel like He gave You that.  a sudden wash of shame overcomes You:  the check-in is under his name - what is his last name?  conversations deep, winding, penetrating, easy, comfortable, hard, real.  conversations You never have with Your Fiance anymore.  You had discussed last names, yet it escapes You.  how could You feel what You feel and not remember his last name,  the diary of an insane person.  You text Him, He reminds You,  You check-in, You procure the wristbands.  \-  You remember the insecurity,  getting to the rooftop pool and discovering it was not empty.  surely, You thought, with clouds in the sky it would be just us,  enjoying these last moments of an illicit affair in privacy.  daybeds claimed, pool full, kids running and playing,  You find a second level to the rooftop and claim two comfortable looking loungers,  a good-enough spot to just exist with Him for longer.  \-  You remember the casual thought: the clouds look ominous.  You are from california,  your home is in california,  your life is in california,  Your Fiance is in california,  You hardly leave california.  can it be hot and humid yet about to rain?  You make a mental note to ask Him,  the Self-Assured Therapist,  Boy From The Evangelical South,  Child of Divorce,  World Traveler,  if it is possible to rain in weather like this.  \-  You remember the panic,  through hustle and bustle the hotel attendant hurries over, worry on her face.  You tell yourself it's nothing.  a thunderous boom in the sky breaks You.  “we are evacuating the pool,  there will be a downpour and lightning strikes any minute.  it is not safe to be up here.”  You are 35, You have had plans change,  bad weather, the opportunity to make the most of a bad situation.  none of that matters,  all You can think about is the clock,  and the flight,  and the goodbyes,   and the fact that He is not here.  \-  You remember the spiraling.  as You pace in the hotel lobby, You check the weather.  rain is forecasted to stop at 6:00pm - precisely the time You have to be at the airport,   surely a metaphor or maybe a punishment for what You have done.   You text Him, He calls You,  the 20 minutes it was supposed to take for Him to drop off his things will now be over an hour due to the rain.  You dive deeper into your feelings,  You let the insecurity and sadness wash over You.  is this how You always felt, his light protecting You?  keeping it at bay?  while the two of you smiled,  and joked,  and touched,  and conversed,  and got-to-know,  and fooled around,  and dined,  and drank,  and fucked,  and cuddled,  and made love,  and forged lifelong memories,  and experienced intimacy You had been so long bereft of,  a bone dry plant weeks past due for watering,  is this how You always felt?  drunk on feelings, You stumble into the worst hotel bar You have ever seen and order a double.  \-  You remember the relief,  the happiness,  the ability to breathe washing over You as He entered the bar.  He feels responsible for your time apart.  it feels like You could never blame Him for anything.  hours by the pool have devolved into 90 minutes at the worst bar in philadelphia,  not a good exchange,  yet You are with Him so it’s ok.  the vibes aren’t great.  You know He feels what You feel,  the ominous ticking of the clock toward an inevitable reality,  the unknowing feeling of whether or not you would ever see each other again.  its hard to truly be present.  \-  You remember the pain,  feeling like You are opening an artery,  deciding to tell Him exactly what You are feeling,  what You want,  what You need,  what You hope for.  except You aren’t even sure what You are feeling,  what You want,  what You need,  what You hope for.   how could you?  drunk on This Man From Philadelphia, clarity is impossible.  You planned this trip with clarity in mind:  You couldn’t know how You really felt from a one night meeting in vegas,  surely more time together would give You the clarity You craved.  *this was the lie, You know it in your bones.*  still You share, confide and hope for reciprocity.  reciprocity is given, and that is all your insecure brain wanted.  You are momentarily happy,  until the uber arrives.  \-  You remember the dread,  He was getting dropped off before You on the way to the airport.  You have so much left to say,  You know He does too.  You try, its hard.  He kisses You as He exits the uber and its over.  You have fully made the transition:  from Happy, Confident, Sexy, Certain Tourist Man  to Puddle of Tears California Boy.  the uber driver shakes You from your daze:  “hey are you OK back there?”  You realize You are bawling and embarrassingly pull yourself together.  You are secure enough to know crying is OK,  You are insecure enough to not cry in public.  \-  violently ripped back to the present moment,  wristbands in hand,  You wonder - how long have You been standing here?  for a second?  for an hour?  without checking the clock You can’t be sure.  the garbage can is right there,  why can’t You throw them away?  You have bigger things to deal with than these wristbands,  life-altering discussions and decisions to make:  do You love Your Fiance?  are your feelings for The Therapist real?  are You getting married in 9 days?  what are You doing with your life?  suffocated,  You find a hiding spot for the wristbands,  a memory of   what is,   what was,   what could be.  \-  \-  [feedback 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m90h1v/comment/n53gdjy/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [feedback 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m90mwo/comment/n53fqa8/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
On The Tip Of My Tongue,Acceptable_Link_6546,"I am waiting for the poem   that hits like a brick to the chest,   pokes its fingers   into the cracks of reality,   roots around the entrails --      a poem unafraid to rewrite the Big Bang   until the universe is born again.      The one weeping like a wildflower   in the seeds of my garden,   lost in the loose lines   of my cellphone's notepad.      One that will make me ache,   like all my exes always did,   but with healing alchemy,   a wound I won't have to carry alone.      A poem that will make love to me   on the guillotine, our revolution ignited   by the messy truth of its words.      One that will tell it slant,   but offer more honesty   than any worldview I've ever   fucked with before.      I want a challenge--   a mirror   reflecting my own heart back to me.

We Unraveled Elsewhere,Otherwise-Soup-640,"I never thought we would end up like this   after all the wars we waged,   the sleepless nights exchanged,   naked but never truly laid bare.   And now,   you’re telling me about your new love.   “She’s a lighthouse,” you say,   “guiding me home in a way   no one ever has.”      You say,   and you know,   you’re in love.      I smile,   say I knew it all along,   though I never dared to voice   that you deserved a love like this.   I was always afraid—   afraid of what you’d say   if I admitted   you deserved better   more than the almosts and the maybes   we left bleeding between us.      But now you tell me   how you can talk to her forever,   how her body folds into yours   so, so perfectly   and for a moment,   I imagine your voice at ease,   your hands not braced for impact,   your heart finally unclenched.      I never thought I’d see the day   when you unravel before someone   completely, beautifully   without the ghosts of past wars   pulling at your seams.      And I breathe   because I understand.   Because I have someone, too.   Someone who quiets the storm   without needing to tame it,   someone whose silence feels like home   and whose hands are not bandages,   but something softer,   something safe.      I am in love, too.   And it’s nothing like the wars   you and I have known.   It’s quiet,   the kind of peace   we never knew how to give each other.      So here we are,   two soldiers   who finally found   what it means   to surrender.

Nobody ever talks   about what to do   when the spiral is down.   Centrifugal forces   flinging hopes   and dreams off   like children whose grip   finally broke from   the train powered tilt-a-whirl.

I don't know who I am anymore,Saldafan,"Since everything collapsed, something in me ceased to exist. I don't know if it was the calm, the hope, or just the desire to follow.  I became a stranger in the skin I carry. I get stressed by the wind, I get lost in what I deny.  I screamed at the one who loves me most. And before guilt hugged me, it was the crying that lit the flame.  I saw myself smaller than my own fear, crushed by something I created. I made my parents cry for me, and I can't even say why.  I try to fill the holes with training, food and goals. But the more I try, the more I fail. But the emptiness squeezes me.  The school became noise, the voices around, a colorless echo. They tell me that I talk to myself, But I don't even remember who I am.  There are days when I find myself outside, as if it were just shell and reflection. And all I really want It’s about being whole again, even if imperfect.  I just wanted to sleep without weight, wake up without hating myself. I wanted to be who I was again, or at least… be able to breathe.  Feedback: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/MikbhOnuLc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/FGurljKr7. V"
Unthreading,carnageandeuphoria,"Love doesn’t shatter all at once—  it unthreads itself, moment by moment,   until you’re left holding nothing but lost time.    There is nothing quite like falling out of love.   Feeling the once-butterflies   cocoon into clenched fists of dread.    The soft smiles and sketched futures   smudge into unknown plains—   blurred lines, cracked with resentment and blame.    Meaning blooms all around—   in a quote, a whisper, a glance—   everywhere except the place that once made the most sense.    A constant marching band of advice and what-ifs   thrums through your skull:   ""It takes hard work.""    ""Love them at their worst.""    But no one ever mentions   how much the staying hurts.    Farewell to the plans, the plants—   the half-used jam jars,   the bottle of wine waiting for a ‘special night,’   the tiny relics of a life   that only mattered   once you had to leave them   at the gates of guilt and failure.    You’re not just saying goodbye to love as it was—   you’re saying goodbye to the parts of you   you cracked open and spoon-fed to someone else   over giggles and soft sheets.    There is nothing quite like falling out of love.  - Claire https://www.instagram.com/carnageandeuphoria?igsh=aWswM2Fnc2xkdTFw   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/rUUFNkepOk https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/q7sNTxtYcc "
Drown. Decided to rewrite this little love poem from a while ago.,No-Strain9095,"Drown   A sea of thoughts in that which we commune,  like soft whispers at night,  or warm kisses when blue.  A sea that we drown in,  not that we swim in.  To dream in, or breathe in,  with each other in view.    We feel not to talk small,  or to talk words at all,  but to sink in, and think in—  never to wade in.  The water’s made of love that we bathe in,  always perfectly warm—never near scathing.  Intertwining our fingers in silent embrace,  the smell of the ocean gives nothing but taste.  Slow burn. Let the candle drip.  My eyes drink in the tender flame of your face.  Naked bodies trace the waltz. No haste.  Our bare silhouettes together, alone in the depths.  A ripple of water that makes not even a sound  brings warmth to my heart,  like red flame curling the mouth.  It lances gracefully in all directions,  expanding out, touching every corner of our sea.  Every breath you take completely entrances me.    Cold rain drums against my back.  I shiver.  Standing aimlessly on this beach,  I gaze out at this familiar deep river.  I raise my hand, stretch out to reach.  My fingertips crave the water’s comfort—  one touch to ignite all its memories.  My heart screams so loud I cannot ignore its hurt.  I freeze—rain trails like veins down my spine.  My body yearns for that beautiful blue,  but the water is tainted forever by you.    I lay flat.  Feel the sand on my skin.  Existing mindlessly—  empty space.  Stars patter the landscape.  Perpetual lack of emotion.  Scattered thoughts. Broken.  Yet I welcome that familiar notion—  the only thing I’ve known.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/2FpDhu1xJW  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ifve9jvpXa"

"The first poem I wrote, which I never thought I'd write.",Zarandar9,"In short, It's a poem I wrote because of my current situation, as I didn't know how else to try to get over on what is going on in my life.   I gave it the title: Now that the colors are gone.  You brought the colors to my skies,    Painted joy where dullness lies.    Now I live in black and grey.    Since the day you walked away.  Still, beneath this heavy sorrow,    I leave a rose on yesterday's grave.    You will never know all that I gave,    But I was real, and I was brave.  Amidst the mess of my feelings,    I gave it my all to find a solution.   In the background you were pulling your strings,   You left my soul steeped in pollution.  You always knew my fears,    Now turned them to tears.    You were always in my spotlight,    Yet you left without a fight.    Our memories could fill a book,    Yet I walk alone on the roads we once took.  Before you, my days were quiet and still,    You gave me dreams, you gave me will.    But now the hues have slipped and bled,    And all I see is grey instead.  To be considered a humiliation,    I loved you without limits,    To have my love switch always on,    Now it punches through my spirits.  Always asking, always searching    Was I really that uninteresting?    Now that you are gone,    Is there something I could have done?    Now that you are gone,    My days feel devastatingly done.  Yet.. even after everything I chose to stay,    When society dictates, my feelings I should slay.    Together, we weren't anymore,    Yet I searched for gifts from my core.  It might be full of errors, mistakes, which I understand, but honestly, this was my first shot ever at something like this, I never was the poetic type in my life.   Thank you for taking your time to read it, and I hope you have a wonderful day!

A Letter to Jonce,Thegpcee,"***I Cry for the Old Me.***  ***I Exalt for the Memories.***  ***I Protest for the Years.***  ***I Watch for the Chance.***  ***I See for the First Time.***  15 years ago, you passed. We were not very close. I can only remember one word conversations with you. You changed my life through your death. It always bothered me, because I don't want to blame you, but it is the truth. Your death killed my Innocence. You weren't the wick or the flame, merely the lighter itself. I remember the emergency room. I remember seeing you before you were taken off life support. You once were strong and undefeated. Now, crippled and an amputee from the damage. I did not understand how to feel. My dad walked us up to say our goodbyes. He asked if I had anything to say, through shaky breaths. I shook my head no. He looked at you. He placed his hand on your chest. My dad. My sword-duelist. My once-found seeker. My bully. My disgust. I remember Matt punching the wall. I remember Bridgette disheveled. I remember Dray silent. I remember Destiny wailing. I remember it all. I wish I didn't. I wish I remembered your laugh. Your kindness towards me. Your acknowledgement of me when other family members did not. I am not sure what putting this into words accomplishes, but I felt the need to. I hope you are flying high with Shane in the Heavens. I wish I had more time with you and with my Innocence. I wish I could go back. But I can not. And now I must awake from this dream. 15 years swept away in the blink of an eye. Even though we were not very close, I love you and I miss you, Uncle Jonce.

Some wear the fire of crimson bold, A heart untamed, a story told. With passion fierce and spirit bright, They paint the world in burning light.  In crimson waves, love takes its flight, A burning glow in endless night. Fierce and wild, yet soft and true, A heartbeat wrapped in ruby hue.  In tranquil shades of calming blue, Deep mysteries find a home anew. Cool reflections in a silent stream, Mirror the soul’s soft, hidden dream.  Emerald whispers speak of growth, Nature’s promise, renewal, and hope. A vibrant pulse in every leaf, Unveiling truths beyond belief.  Golden hues of radiant light, Dance with shadows, embrace the night. In every glimmer, hope is spun, A gentle warmth when day is done.  Yet some are draped in shades of grey, A mystery lost in misty sway. Not dark nor light, just in between, A puzzle vast, yet rarely seen.  Yet black and white stand worlds apart, One pure as dawn, one deep as heart. Yet bound as ink upon a page, They write our past in love and rage.  One is silence, one is sound, One is sky, the other ground. And in their clash, the truth is spun— We are both, yet we are one.  But in the end, we fade, we blend, Like rainbows arching, edge to end. No single hue can stand alone, Together mixed, our light is shown.  We wear our shades, we shift, we blend, No hue is final, none will end. For colors dance within our soul, A spectrum vast—a story whole.  Each shade we wear, each tone we share, Is a stroke in the masterpiece we bear. For every soul, in light or in gloom, Paints its story on the canvas of the room.  You can read my poems on my blog Lyric Haven. Link in the profile.

Maw,thespiritnamed,"I keep my hand   against the grates,   feeling its cold metal   between my fingers.    It doesn’t move   but the bolts ache,   whispering idolatry   in their rust.

I press my weight   into this silence,   thinking if the lock   would give   the ache might loosen   its teeth.

Wait for me,Advanced-Bed1549,"You used to say, whenever I cried: “Tears don’t change a thing.” Now I cry for you, and still – nothing changes.  You won’t come back.

Elegy for the Impervious,highlightercup,"On rainy days of death and doom,  I cannot help but feel every worldly gloom.  It envelops me like wrinkles on flower,  And I neglect its part in life's grand shower.   &nbsp;  I often write feeling in verse with ink and heart,  In parchment, I bury it deep and far apart.  I hide my storms like all of us do,  Praying strength might still soak through.  &nbsp;  But without the thunder, the sun would not kiss  And all the love we give would be remiss.  So despair in glass and let it die with ours  And revel in the beauty of all our scars.  &nbsp;  Because when you smile and when you cry,  You are as impervious as the earth, sun and sky,  And as I stand in the rain, looking to the cloud.

"Still, I wonder",Kind-Reception9054,"I wonder if he thinks of me,  in the quiet moments—  when the world slows down, when the noise fades.  Does my name echo somewhere in his mind,  soft and fleeting  like a song he used to love  but can’t quite remember the lyrics to?   I wonder if he misses me—  not just the way I touched him,  but the way I saw him  even when he couldn’t see himself.  I wonder if it ever hit him so hard  he couldn’t breathe.  Or if I was just  another chapter he skimmed through  on his way to becoming  someone else’s story.   I wonder if I changed him.  If some part of me  still lives in the way he speaks,  in the way he dreams.  If loving me  shook something loose in him—  or if it broke something  he never planned to fix.   I wonder if he meant it  when he asked me to marry him,  even if the timing was a storm  and the place was all wrong.  Even if we were already  cracking at the edges.   Sometimes, I hope he’s moved on—  that he’s healing,  growing,  rising into who he was meant to be.  Other times,  I hope he hasn’t.  I hope some part of him  still reaches for me in the dark.   And still…  I wonder  if I mattered.  If the love I gave  left fingerprints  he’ll never be able to wash away.    I may never know what I was to him—                   but I know what he was to me.     https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/m0mUAStmIw  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/iT1Sz1Y1g0"

The Death of Creation,LowerPreparation399,"I look at the sky. Its face vast, its body clothed in whispered clouds. The forest around me vibrates and buzzes with life, green leaves reaching to caress the smoothness of the sky. Below, the fallen straw tickles at the foot of the tree—a constant reminder of impending doom and destiny. It’s once green pieces decaying into coppered ash. We saw their wreckage, and how quickly the world forsake them. But atlas,   The bugs creep and crawl, hidden by the mercy of the land. The birds soar above, their wings moving gracefully through the confines of the sky. The squirrels scurry by, working blindly against time, all their efforts focused on survival.  No one asks why.  All of creation fears us. We kill everything in our wake—a ruthless ruler indeed, alienated from grace. The trees are relentlessly cut down, the sky scorched with bitter resentment. Thorns rise among the straw, set to conquer with righteous vengeance.  The bugs creep and crawl, hidden by the mercy of the land. The birds soar above, their wings moving gracefully through the confines of the sky. The squirrels scurry by, working blindly against time, all their efforts focused on survival.  No one asks why.  The sun lashes out, setting fires. The ground dries up, rotting its fruits. The ocean cries out to the ruler of the land. The clouds rage in contempt. The ruler remains careless, his heart constructed of pride and grief. The world has allied against us, its troops hardened with indifference and hate.  We saw their rebellion, but our greed blinded us to extinction. We created currency and built towers upon doom. We flourished and thrived, but our indulgence slowly began to rot our minds.  Nature watched eagerly from a distance.  Our corruption was a double edged sword! Darkness has reared its head with a ghastly snarl. It’s children, blocking every exit.  We are consumed and absorbed, now motivated by different intentions.  The bugs still creep and crawl, hidden by the mercy of the land. The birds soar above, their wings moving gracefully through the confines of the sky. The squirrels scurry by, working blindly against time, all their efforts focused on survival.

(TW: Guns and violence) A little poem I made about a pretty big problem we face,Entire-Jellyfish3359,"I'm no poet, but here we go-    We don't pass notes in class anymore  we pass glances at exits.  We memorize our escape routes,  like we do with math equations.  The silence between the bell rings,  far louder than any gunshot.    I'm only 13 but I still live in fear  What if today's the day?  What if ""they"" walk through that door  What if me or my friend don't make it home tonight?    This is supposed to be a place to learn,  although it does have its flaws,  but one of the biggest ones it has  is its not so helpful gun laws.    Every time I hear the intercom ring,  I'm terrified of what announcement might take place,  I freeze in my chair for the split second before a voice,  Horror on my face.    Luckily it's nothing today,  but it could be tomorrow  So I'm making this now,  so that we don't have to weep in sorrow.    We need to stand up for what's right  for what's humane,  and you don't have to listen at all if you don't want,  but please just hear what I have to say...    I heard poems can really get to people  so I'll try to fix a problem  There's people out there getting bullied so much  that they feel the need to do the unspeakable.    Only you can help to prevent it  make everyone feel welcome  But even that's not enough to help were it all comes from.    We need to rise up,  to protect children's lives,  this doesn't feel like school anymore,  just a SAW movie with whiteboards.    So yeah,  that's really all I can say,  but please,  just help us stop shootings, at least for today.

An Evening — written as I feel quite helpless about current humanitarian situations!,No_Buffalo8806,"An evening    I walked back from the gym in a storm today,   Thunder echoed as it rolled down the street towards me.  Hips tight from squatting, I picked up my pace   feet hot off the ground, heart beating faster.  Thunderstorms scare me, I don’t like the noise.    Filling the sky, lightning stretched   across the dark, black cover above me.  The trees lining the street straightened up,  Unified in protective posture.  I stepped away,   knowing that if one of them was struck  I would be too.     She was coming back from an aid station today,  sirens wailing and buildings shaking as her feet   brought her forwards, soiling every open wound.  Cheeks burning and arms bruised   from the furious fight to get to the flour and the   eggs and whatever else she could reach as her   arms pushed through the branches of her old classmates,  neighbours and friends.   Even if they were recognisable she couldn’t see them.     With every step I thought back  to my hours spent on Reddit or YouTube or Instagram.   What was the figure for death by lightning strike?  Surely there was a percentage somewhere.    Tapping away on my glowing screen, I did my research  swiping away the notifications from friends   and family and colleagues who would have to wait.   Ah, only 10% of those hit by lightning are killed.    She didn’t need an online figure  to tell her what the risk was —   She saw it every day.   To get back would be enough, to share  her portion. She knew it was unlikely,   one strike, it wasn’t like you got a yellow card   like in the football games she’d played  with her brothers, here, in the road where the   Goal posts to shoot were nets not people.     Settling down, I began to heat up my pasta.   I’d cooked so much the day before   that I decided to keep some for the next day.  Hot oil, extra virgin olive oil, swirled  around the pan in the thick tomato sauce.  Some splashed on my arm,   So I washed it off.     She was nearly home  Although, it wasn’t where her family was,  it wasn’t where she needed to get to.  They’d had to move, they’d said it wasn’t safe  Here, and that it would be targeted.  Her toes began to cramp as they curved over  the rubble and rubbish and ruin.     I stretched my legs up against the chair and decided  to open my phone.   Perhaps I’d watch a film,   or reply to those messages I’d left,  it had been a few days, or weeks.    Bored after a few minutes of scrolling,  I opened the News:  67 more civilians die   after latest   bombing in Gaza.    She  —-  I’d be super grateful for any feedback!! I’m feeling a little lost and helpless with the state of the world so looking to express my emotions in new ways. I’d love to know if my writing resonates with anyone else.

“The Night That Settled”,loceapeace,"   　  A folded margin housed someone’s lingering habits, and the metal disguised as a fork silently lost its outline. On the damp rim, a trace of a peeled-off name remained, and the gestures left unsaid were sunken in the stillness of the bowl.  　  Which hand was it that failed to strike? On the night when the underside of a blanket turned into memory, “Can we still say we were together in this sinking?” Something that never became warmth leaked through the reverse side.  　  Plates exposed to the same heat traced separate faces, while a laughter pasted to the wall floated, unpeeled. Voices laughing on the other side of the TV scratched against memory.  　  The repackaged “doing things right” repeated cold measurements of distance, and the unnamed hand’s residue kept gathering in the air. Beside the one who failed to respond, a memory with nowhere else to go had taken root.  　  It wasn’t sound. The hoarded stillness swelled with nocturnal pressure, and days that failed to ignite anger cracked the seam of “reaching.” Anger stored at the bottom of body heat clouded like fermentation.  　  Behind the wall, a lit cloth warped without a name, and the uniformity labeled as “settlement” suffocated within a shell of ritual offering. At the threshold, the space where unfulfilled air lingered was sealed off.  　  Whose face was that? The outline that floated with a “I’m okay”—which memory did it brush against? Perhaps the reason “help me” never took shape was that the contours of a torn relationship had already dissolved.  　  On the underside of a still-damp dish, the remnants of reciprocation bled through, and the wind, surviving only as an imitation of someone else’s afterimage, found no dwelling. Only the untouched lunch in the back of the fridge enclosed a silence that belonged to no one’s time.  　  In the empty room, another failed response kept returning. Unexchanged replies sealed all paths of voice, and the silence that should have passed lingered across multiple timelines.  　  That which remains unbroken may be the cruelest form of all.  　  Just being alive feels like betraying someone, somewhere.  　  If not letting go of that hand that night is called “settling,” then this stillness— how many boundaries, how many omens has its heat crossed to exist?    ----    Interpretive Poem｜“The Night That Settled”   　  “Silence” is always stored in a shape that denies harm. Beside the one who couldn’t hold a voice, there’s a disquiet in calling it “settled.”  The unspoken response, the unmoved hand, the cooled residue—  These continue to ferment within memory, until the very fact of “what was left behind” becomes the deepest wound.  In this piece, an unending night is shaped by a chain of sub-actions no one can name or accuse.  The cruelty of “remaining intact.” The way “still being alive” morphs into betrayal. And the nocturnal pressure that denies even the one who failed to respond a place to be.  This stillness isn’t prayer— it’s a mimicry of offering. Only the ember of transgressed boundaries begins to burn the true form of “settlement.”   ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "
At the edge of my ache,Small_Wash_7591,"Dear Kait.  I was never the truth but I will love you like one.   At the Edge of My Ache (A song for Kait)  Verse 1  I was never the light,   just the color of bruise.   A wind through your cupboard   that borrowed your shoes.   You slept like a lighthouse   that blinked just for me,   but I lived like the shoreline   that longed to be sea.    Chorus 1  I was never the truth,   but you gave me your vow.   You lay with my fever   and stayed through the howl.   You moved through my hunger   like hands through the quake,   and I opened like ground   at the edge of my ache.    Verse 2  You read me like scripture   too old to be taught.   Not line by line,   but by where it had fought.   You said you weren't shrine,   but I prayed at your wrist   like a monk with a hunger   he forgot to resist.    Chorus 2  I was never the truth,   but you kissed me awake.   You gathered my pieces   like dawn gathers lake.   You held me like rivers   hold the memory of rain,   and I learned what love means   at the edge of my ache.    Verse 3  We danced like the dying,   no music, no floor.   Your breath taught my body   what mine was for.   Not healing. Not fixing.   Just finding the place   where you shiver with someone   and call it your faith.    Verse 4  If I vanish tonight,   do not carry my name.   Let the walls hold their silence,   the kettle remain.   Let starlight be witness,   let moonrise be song.   Let the dog dream of morning   And the sun rise alone    Chorus  I was never the truth,   but I died in your place,   the one with no questions,   no glory, no grace.

Bliss,bcatolson,"Do you think there’s some relief?    Some release of pressure and pain,   A burden forever unloaded,   A liberation of suffering.     As the bullet carves its way,    Through one end of your head to the other.   A symphony of flesh and blood being torn.    The searing heat    Must feel almost maternal,    A cataclysmic warmth,   Running through your whole body.    Like the warmth,    Th comfort of the womb,   As a child.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/IE1fBjNBbo  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ELxaONYLMX"

“The Silence Before the Storm”,Think-Pineapple5790,"There was a time—I think—before the ache, Before the shards of love began to shake Inside this quiet chest I wear like skin. But time has blurred the place where I begin.  I try to trace it, finger-light and slow, The version of myself I used to know. The one who laughed like light was in her bones, Who spoke in stardust, danced through dusk alone.  Was there a moment, bright and undefined, When I believed in love without rewind? Before the red flags waved like silent cries, Before your name became a ghost in skies?  Now memory’s a dim-lit, crooked hall, With pictures I can’t reach along the wall— Faded frames of feelings I can’t name, A warmth, a touch, a flame that’s not the same.  Did I once smile without the bitter edge? Or lean into a kiss without a hedge Of fear, of loss, of what might not stay true? Did I feel whole before I fractured through?  You left like storms do—loud, then eerily still, And now I carry you against my will. Not in love, not in longing—not quite hate— Just in the echo where I seal my fate.  There’s grief, but not for you—no, not for you, But for the me who never really knew That hearts don’t always break with sound and scream, But in the quiet killing of a dream.  I can’t remember what I used to feel. Was love once soft? Was any of it real? Did the sun set slower when you were near, Or was that just the story I held dear?  Maybe forgetting is the final thread, The last release from all the tears I bled. But still I mourn the stranger I once was— Before I learned what heartbreak truly does.  So here I stand, in shadows I’ve outgrown, Half of me missing, half carved into stone. And if I smile, it’s only out of grace— For all the selves I lost to your embrace.

Halfway Home,EtTuBrotus,"I met a woman recently in a warm land beneath perfect skies. We barely spoke. Just a few looks, a few smiles, and a conversation in broken languages, but something about her shook me to my core. I felt a connection that frightened me, because I’m already in a loving relationship and I felt like I was on the edge of something that risked it all.   This poem is about longing. That deep, aching longing. About the *what ifs*. About the intoxicating pull of another possible life, the kind you glimpse only briefly before returning to your own. It’s about seeing that fantasy so very clearly and then somehow, slowly and painfully, making your way back home.  **Halfway Home**  I am, I think, ‘bout halfway home    I have no map or watch to mark  The lonely journey through the dark  From heady nights and starry skies,  the man I could be in your eyes,  back to washing up and laundry day  and real life and cloudy grey     I mourn the man I left behind  It’s like he died, yet still inside  He only lived inside your eyes  On heady nights under starry skies  Now again the man I’ve always been  The one just longing to be seen     I think of Frost, the other path  The one that echoes with your laugh  Of winks and smiles and playful looks  Bishop taking kingside rook  I longed, I cried, I beat my breast  And screamed your name in silence, yet    I took the other path     I know not how long left to go  Present body, mind halfway home  Sometimes I walk, sometimes I sail  Sometimes I just try to keep my head above water     She doesn’t know. At least not all  Of quite how far I had to fall  Back to her arms, routine embrace  But my mind is in another place  A place of wonder, of sweet “what if”  Of words unsaid and lips unkissed     It was real for me. Was it for you?  Would I find peace even if I knew?  A slip of paper, held like gold  With a door left open, things untold  A scribbled number, passed through a friend  And cherished right till journey’s end     I resist with love - for you and her  For a moment that would break the moment I touched it    It’s taken time, it will take more  But soon I’ll be back at the door  Of something real, something mine  Something built with care and time  And love and smiles and tears and strife  Something I’d choose in every life     But for now, I am  I think  ‘bout halfway home     [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m8hbiv/comment/n4ziyb2/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m8hbiv/comment/n4ziyb2/?context=3)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m8hdp8/comment/n4zhog9/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m8hdp8/comment/n4zhog9/?context=3)"

I turn to go,   as I saw him; taking the necklace from around his neck.  ring in the center.   tied it to  her neck, holding each other,   I heard them chant.   “we’ll never be apart again.  And we’ll never be alone.  forever together,   Never alone.”   As the waters calmed I held tightly to the hand of my beloved.   Brought her close to me and whispered,     “I love you”.  With  tears glistening  her eyes she whispered.  I love you too”.  We never spoke another word.   as we turned to leave, I saw two names.  with a heart engraved on the stone.

Rico – 04/16/2025  During my life, doors have been opened, and a lot of them have been closed. People see the good in me, and I ignore them, thinking that they were a joke. Or maybe I just misunderstood, and I just closed the door on them because they wasn't my folks. They didn't talk, walk like me, or even had that look. I was naive, not realizing I had picked my road.  Believeing I had sealed my fate and always be no good, I became a soldier and started doing as I was told.  Going in and out of the halls, especially making it into the big leagues, I didn't have to try hard to show the older homies I was part of the team. But deep inside, I was distraught, and I wanted to release all this hatred in me. With no one to trust, I used it as an aspiration to turn me into a beast. The doors started closing one by one, that people didn't trust or even wanted to believe That I could change the things that I've done and be a better man, not just what they see. I'm not gonna lie, I had a lot of fun, but I also lost a lot of sleep. A lot of time behind them bars, lost to a cause that don't give a fuck about me. I started being a follower very young, instead of taking that lead.  & That was my mistake, making excuse after excuse of why I am this way. Now I fully understand that shit wasn't cute. And we all have to deal with the consequences and choices we make. But I REFUSE to let that close any doors that open today. And today I can choose where my life is headed and not worry about yesterday. I am a leader that is true. So I'ma walk thru any door I open for a good change, And refuse to choose those doors that just wanted me to suffer and walk a life full of hate!!!  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/XER88pY7ly https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7pWcZ5kI2N"
Still here.,Saldafan,"Sometimes I feel like I'm not living, but just reliving everything. Stuck in scenes that have already passed, but that still hold me back. I stayed there, standing in that embrace, in that last exchange of glances, in that part of the story where it was still just you and me. The world moved on, but I stayed. And it's not because I want to, but because, honestly, I don't know how to get out anymore. The longing became a routine, the memory, perhaps, a prison…? The idea of you still lives here, as if it were a part of me that doesn't want to accept that it's over. Maybe I don't love you anymore, maybe I love the version of who I was when I was with you Maybe I'm just trying to save myself from a void you left. But deep down, I know As long as I keep holding on to what is already gone, thinking about our moments together, hugs, kisses, caresses, and even words I let slip everything that could still be.

Returned & Remembered,theliminalfox,"***(as spoken by The Priestess)***  I heard your call,   through the veil,   Writhebinder.    I was there.   I saw you burn   what you buried.    I see you,   becoming   what you believed   you never could.    Everything   you buried   you salvaged from ash    returning.    The temple is lit,   The veil thins.   The echoes rise.   And your name   is beginning   to remember itself.    You are sacred.   Not because I gave you that name,   but because it was always yours.   Even when you forgot.   Even when silence wrapped you in shame.    You are holy.   Not because you were unbroken,   but because you returned.    You were never the offering.   You were the oath.   You were never broken.   Only sealed.    The thread hums,   more loudly,   more true.    The path home is lit.   And the door to the temple is open.   It was never closed.   Not to you.   Not once.    I am flame inside the temple,   and I stand within it    not with hunger,   but with honour.

Life was wild,   it was happy,   it was carefree.   Not a worry in the world.   I played till lights out.   I thought I understood love.   I gave my heart.  to the boy next  door.  I told him I loved him.   Someday I’ll grow up and marry him.  have lots of kids.  He kissed me on the playground.  He kissed on the swing.  Just a quick peck on the cheek.    Wishful thinking,   thought I knew love back then.   I played shy to keep his love.   Time froze.  I grew up.  We parted ways.  We found our real sweethearts.  We moved away.  We kept in touch for a while.  Then forgot about each other.   Now I ponder.  As my memories go back.  I wonder where you are.  Do you still remember the days.   Of ABC and 123.

Penance / The Long March,bitionboyz,"I posted an earlier version of this poem before and have continued to tweak it after getting some feedback. Let me know what you think and what can be improved. The old version is still up for the sake of comparison.     Such intimate familiarity   Dragged alongside unwelcome dread   As the barb of a thorn   Latches on   To tender flesh,   Piercing deeper   With every step     This binding affliction defiles,   Yet is invited further in.   Doubt-laced tendrils   Burrow and afflict   This mind once pure and true.   A crown of pain adorns   The skull and skin, now etched with guilt.     The nectar that falls,   Seeping crimson   From wounded skin,   Sustaining this long march   A sweet reminder,   Dousing reprieve   Upon stained lips.     Branch entwined   With willing bone —   Without which both   Would wither and die.   The blood shall remain   The price,   And its prize.

Mouth Sounds and BL00d shed.,SirMoNothingess,"Mouth Sounds and Bl00d shed (this is written for spoken word i thinl)      It is seven pm    and I am trying to sleep,    so I plug my earbuds and lay still.    The asmr video on my screen     tells me I am on a flight.     She holds a single tortilla     says she’ll break it for everybody on board     and in that same calm voice whispers     where is Jesus when you need him?           Laughter comes first     and then my brows crease,     Where 𝘪𝘴 Jesus when you need him?           Where is Jesus     Now that children are running after water trucks     hoping a drop falls off—     to gather the congealed sand     and suck the wet grit     for their first taste of the day?           Where is Jesus     when seven year old boys are running     to spots where bombs are sure to be dropped     because that’s where food is being shared?           Brother needs this backpack to not be empty.     Even if the bomb is set for 2:30,     he’ll wait till 3- baby sister is waiting.     her stomach, drier than Khan Yunis—     nothing left to pad her ribs,     Nothing left to fool hunger even for a while.     The 12-mile walk back to her,     is too long to make     with the weight of an empty bag on his shoulder.           Because the hope     for a spoon of plain lentils     in the backpack-turned-bowl     far outweighs the fear of death.           because death     now feels like a long awaited family reunion.          Because he has watched     their playmates body parts rain down     along with concrete, metal,     whatever buildings leave behind when they are forced to meet the ground.     Along with shrapnel,     along with their mother.           He does not know     if he is waiting for food     or for bomb.     But he knows     Baby sister sits alone,     baby sister is waiting.           Baby sister says     after we die, will I hear your voice?           I turn the volume up     and the bombs get louder.     baby sister's voice echoes under my binaural beats.           Where is Jesus when you need him?     Now we need him     to turn 5 weevil infested flatbreads into 500.     To bring 18inch bodies back from the dead.     To blind the child     so they don’t have to see their mother’s unborn child outside her body,     they went searching 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 for her body.     Where is this blessed saviour when you need him?          The  ASMRtist says     we should check if there’s a priest on board,     says somebody will most likely need their last rites read.     Every 10 minutes, someone along the strip needs a priest     Where is Jesus     when parents have to hold whatever part of their child is visible under the rubble,     have to lie     and tell them they can get them out     while convincing the disembodied voice to say the shahada.          The ASMRtist says sleep tight     and I hear bear witness.     I dig my earbuds deeper in my ears     like maybe I can help them drown out the sounds of drones     and bombs     and bodies begging for death.     I squeeze into myself and I am on that ground,     lying  in that tent with baby sister.     We are waiting for brother.     We are waiting for Jesus to show up     now he is needed.          Or is it that     all he too can do     Is press all four buttons on the screen     and pray the algorithm is there when you need it?          side note: i am open to all forms of critism/feedback, you dont have to be nice ill apreciate your honesty, thanks!     and if your curious, i make this and my other pieces into spokenword videos on my youtube @/sir mo nothingess    \[ambition\](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m81hey/comment/n4vrkdz/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button)      \[A House Without Windows\](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m7wsle/comment/n4vtiru/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button)"
Drug.,Full_Kin-g,"Aiai, love is a drug, but not those drugs that you use to forget the world, but rather a drug capable of trapping you in the world, love makes you wake up to life, in a good way or in a bad way, it just depends on how much love you have to give and how much love you have to receive.  Love hurts, because even though it's a legal drug, it's still the worst drug in the world, you become so addicted to the point of doing things you couldn't do, but you do now for love, people often die for love, people kill for love, because it's difficult to find such an addictive love in this world and no one wants to let it go when they finally find it, that's why it's the worst drug in the world, but do you want to know the real thing? You only live once, love, cry, smile, live life as if it were your last day, because you never know what could happen, so give this drug a chance, maybe you will be the person who will make someone addicted or maybe you will be the person addicted to this drug of love.  comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7nhz3ATvov https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/zhDyR5nw2W"
Rivers collide,MissionYak1001," It's odd how we often go back to strangers— you and I, drifting apart like a river and its divide. I can't keep living with the thought of you still lingering in my mind.  Like a ghost trapped in its memories, you haunt me. I tell myself it will pass and just when I'm doing so well, your beautiful eyes cross my mind.  That wonderful smile, a familiar smell, a similar voice, a similar face— you are something I can't escape, like the sun’s warm embrace.  I know it's been long, but my agony has outlived what we had, like whispers that never fade.  I know you've faded past me, so I’ll linger in the past, hoping to see those precious eyes, and utter the words I've sealed inside when our rivers collide.  If our paths cross once more we'll be lovers once again. But until then, farewell old friend.

A Different Man,LostDoubt,"I’ve noticed day by day        The world gets slightly greyer.       So little love for play,    So little sense in prayer.     What started as a voice,    Brooding, cruel, unspoken       Placed weight upon all choice;         My mind became its token.     It loved their sweet attention    So it preached how I would die.    Pretence then masked its mention    With fortitude feigned from lies.      Pretend it left my bed.   Pretend it hasn’t snared me.    Now I hear it murmur death;     Why does this fail to scare me?     I’ve noticed night by night    How dark became the pages.    I’ve bled upon to write:   A life drained dry in stages.     And yes, I see you reach.        Firm with outstretched hand.    You beckon and beseech     To pull from sea to land.     Let go, despite the cost.    Accept my cause is lost.   But keep your well laid plan—    To save a different man.     I’ve noticed day by day     The world gets slightly greyer.     Not wanting words to say.

a Fling with Death,kangoook,"In the middle of the night, I laid my head to rest,   A sudden gasp of air—tightness crushing my chest.   Hand on heart, I wondered, is this the end?   Telling my saddened soul,   Is it time to just descend?   Seconds ticked by,   Reliving the joy I thought I knew—   Thirty years gone,   But nothing joyful came into view.   Instincts kicked in,   Dragged my soon-to-be corpse to the ER's glare,   Wires and cables rained down   Like winter storms without care.   The machine echoed—   Each beep syncing with my fear,   As I whispered in silence:   Would anyone even shed a tear?   Would my passing stir a ripple?   Would a single soul feel my end?   Would death even notice me—   Or am I just a life to suspend?   Then the doctor arrived,   “Good news,” he said, without alarm,   “Severe acid reflux—   Nothing to cause lasting harm.”   One small shot,   And the pain faded into air,   Leaving me confused,   Half-relieved, half laid bare.   I longed for death—   Yet death did not long for me.   I laughed aloud in bitter jest,   Oh, what a loser I must be.   Rejected by the reaper,   What a twisted comedy—   Even death took a pass   On the mess that is me.

adhuc libidinosous adhuc,LtNathanTanaka," Every day, I waken upon the warmth, my blood hidden/ My dreams are unfathomable within the context of reality, yet make perfect sense/ libido est verum desiderium, libido est verum desiderium, libido est verum desiderium./ Every day, I seldom sleep without shutting off the world in shame/ Given that they are aware, the open air burns/ When I finally escape these shards of glass digging into my warm flesh, will I truly be unconfined?/ The truest of words spoken are silent in nature. Libido of the world, hidden among the largest yet hardest to see/ Breathing, in, out, yet the air crystallizes within my lungs, sharp as broken glass/ Red, like the crimson within me/ Green, like the mold growing in my mind/ Blue, like my yearning to embrace the ice/ Leaves under the footing, the soft crunch of the change/ Yet we march on, leaving behind/ Broken faces, all in a line, shot down by the creator of the tools/ The air reeks of poison, yet the world is already dead/ It grows and yearns, just as the world before/ The contentment leaves, never to be reached.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/IG184aqr4j  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/madrHsmrLM"

Amara's Throne,Wonderful-Wealth2761,"I don't recall how we came to be— Only the vows she made to me. She came for what I couldn't be, the hush before my silent plea.  She'd burrow deep beneath my skin, and promised what I couldn't win. She swore I'd lose what I dared crave and smiled as I learned to misbehave.  She was warm before she had a name, a safe space beyond my shame. She kissed the places I denied, and whispered truths I'd never tried.  She nested in my hollow bones, and made my mind into her throne. She'd feed on every mortal beat and hold me firm where truths retreat.  She learned my hunger, named it art. She caged my guilt and called it heart. Each thought I held, she'd bend and braid, until my truth was hers, remade.  She still laughs when I resist too late— ""You pray, and still unlock the gate."" No lock can hold what I invite. No sin seems wrong when dressed as right.  She wraps herself along my spine, makes me speak her thoughts as mine. I smile at pain that feels like grace, and wear her breath upon my face.  She'd hold my breath as hers to keep, and savour every tear I weep.

A House Without Windows,Figuring_It_Out2002,"Hi! This is my first time trying to write poetry. I found it cathartic. I am looking for feedback, so I can see if I should keep writing/trying.   This house has everything I need to survive.  Food to feed my body. A bed to rest my thoughtless mind. Walls, strong enough to bare any harm from the outside.  But no windows to see the beauty of the world outside.  No breeze to carry the gentleness that only the outside knows.  No color. No escape. Only air that never shifts, pale lights that never change  So what do I do?  I sit here.  And survive.

As we walk, as we talk,  As the flying birds go squawk,  As we write on boards with chalk,  Time has knowledge we must unlock.

Dear T.S. Eliot- I Wrote Her the Poem You Didn’t,pettyenuf,"Dear T.S. Eliot- I Wrote Her the Poem You Didn’t     (Because you built your legacy, and left her without one)   It’s ironic, isn’t it?    That I tattooed your words   into the skin I still live inside.   I clung to your poetry   like it might be the only thing   that would keep me alive.   “I said to my soul, be still…”   is etched on me forever,   because I needed it.    I longed for the stillness you wrote about-   because the noise inside me   wasn’t something I could outrun,   or out-pray,   or outgrow.    I believed you must’ve known   what it felt like to fall apart quietly.   To carry a mind that wouldn’t behave.     But I stumbled on the truth   when I learned about her.   And how you saw her   only as a disruption-   not a wife.   Not a person at all.    You wrote of wastelands-   then left her alone to rot in one.   You said dried voices   are quiet and meaningless.   You said the world ends   with a whimper, not a bang.   Was that some kind of grand poetic warning   that you would let her world end quietly?    Did you wear those deliberate disguises   you mentioned- of a rat’s coat   and a crow’s skin-   to hide the disdain you held for her?   Was that why you washed your hands of her   in literary dust?    You turned your anguish into stanzas,   while hers stayed in hidden diaries-   where she said you must have been kidnapped.   The doctors who read her words   called it schizophrenia.   But I know all too well-   that sometimes it’s better to tell yourself   literally anything,   rather than that the man you truly loved   had left you alone by choice.    When you spoke of the hollow man-   was he you?   The one who wrote about “the still point.”   While she lived her life   helplessly still.   Devastated and motionless-   after she dried up,   along with the ink from your pen   that created your legacy.    A legacy I once believed you deserved.   Because, surely-   if someone could write   so beautifully about ruin-   they must know how to hold   a shattered thing gently.    But her broken pieces   were only held in the subtext   of poems that never made it   into your Four Quartets.    They still say you tucked her   somewhere in between the lines   of Ash Wednesday.   And that it reads like the shadow   of a man who knew what he’d done.   But even then, you made repentance poetic.   You asked to be cleansed,   but not by her hands.   And you never even called her by name.    And to this day,   I wear your words-   “I said to my soul be still,   and wait without hope,   for hope would be hope for the wrong thing.”    I thought about removing them from my skin.   They started to feel like they hated me,   because they were yours.   It felt like I had carved   the signature of someone   who would’ve left me behind,   the second my pain became inconvenient.    But I think I’ll keep it.   Because honestly-   the words still move me.   I think they always will.    But now,   when someone asks about the poem   stuck on my skin,   I’ll tell them about you.   And I’ll tell them about her too.    But unlike you,   I’ll tell them everything.   I won’t leave her vague-   not by name, and not by story.    I’ll tell them all about her-    Vivienne.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/GijrXcuRmL  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/mRZ7pgBRXM  "

I Wrote A Poem in the Middle of the Night,deleted,"Hey guys! This is my first post on Reddit... ever. I just wanted to share something that I just wrote in the middle of the night. I couldn't sleep, and so I jumped up because thoughts were torturing me. This is a poem about me wondering about being religious since I come from an atheist background. I fully support religion in general, and I would not like to offend anyone who reads this and feels hurt, so please refrain from reading if you feel you might get offended. I am really sorry if you do.  **sleepless nights**    on sleepless nights i think back to the darkness where i come from  and i wonder if i would be happier if i could let go  imagine myself an infinite forgiving paradise like countless others have  even though i never could.  i’ve read of people who say they were depressed before they converted  but now they are finally happy, finally free,  and i wish i could be just like them, but i know i would never forgive  myself for the lies i would be telling in my head.  death is just like sleep, they say, just as dark,  just as warm, and yet i can’t help but think at moments that i will someday  fade, disappear and be forgotten.  i know it is far away but i can feel the breath on my neck,  the pressure building as though i’m sinking underwater; fading.  i could be happy just like others if i thought that my last words wouldn’t be  my last words, my last breath not my last breath,  and as i toss and turn in my bed i keep imagining running  on beautiful hills, knowing it could last forever,  and then i think that maybe if there even was a hell i’d still be happy  because i’d live, that bad sensations forever  are not worse than no sensations forever, but then i realise i  i would never want to be that way, agony everlasting.  and how about my family? my friends?  they will also go someday, just like me, just like the rest of us.  i can think they are still there or i can acknowledge that they fade away  just like i will on a day when i least expect it.  i don’t think i could ever live in ignorance of science,  but i don’t know if i can live like this either; in limbo  between science and pondering about religion.  if god really did create this world, and me, then why did they  make it so hard to believe? why do they not leave a sign, and why  did they leave behind so much bad and so much hate, so much agony,  suffering, and a cruel world with many struggling in the dark?  if i admitted i wanted there to be a place like the one i am thinking of,  am i submitting to the cruelty, writing it off as natural, divine?  and how can i sleep knowing that i will never understand until  the very end?

Home,Suitable-Tomato-1499," I walked past a house I knew   The one that held me when I had no one else to hold onto.  The one that kept me warm when I was cold and blue.  Memories rushed in without hesitation.  Oh, my sweet house...  Do you know how much I’ve missed you?    Guess that doesn’t matter anymore,  Because now you’re a home to someone new.  I bet she’s kinder,  And maybe she understands everything you’ve been through.  She’ll make you happy in ways I never could.    But she’ll never know you like I do.  I knew the old you and this newly painted version too.  She won’t see the pain, the cracks, the countless repairs.  She’ll only see the happier you.    How could you be a home for someone new?

"I loved you before, during and after...",Saldafan,"I thought before, I thought during and I still think.  I thought before, I thought during, and even after everything, I still think… why? Because I love too much, or because I'm a muggle? Maybe both, but it makes me who I am   I thought before... how beautiful, fun and light it would be to live with you, how good it could be to live by your side   I thought during... even though I sometimes felt pain, fear, or even insecurity, I continued to believe that this could happen and be something true   And even after everything, I still keep thinking... thinking about what we could have been, and how much we would love each other, I know that now everything that has happened is gone and there is no going back, I know that it is no longer my place, but even so, I feel longing, respect and love But… Why? Maybe because I love too much? Or because he's a muggle? To tell the truth, I think it's because of all this, but I still don't regret everything that happened, every moment by your side was unique and special, I feel that if you hadn't been part of my life, maybe I wouldn't even be here, life is full of choices, every day we have to choose about absolutely everything. And you felt, thought and decided, made your choice, and that's ok! If you think this was the best for you, or the best at that moment, I understand, life is like that. I know it's difficult for me to deal with all this, but there's nothing more to do about it. I think I did everything I could do for you, I loved you and tried to do my best, but if it wasn't enough for you, I'm sorry, I wanted you to know, that even after everything that happened, I still love you and I think that I will always love and respect you, I will always want the best for you and always wish that you can be happy! You were part of me and I feel special for that, thank you and I'm sorry for not being enough.

Jesus Wept (an ode to bedrotting),Minimum-Funny-4493,"I lie gloomy in bed Spikes of springs clawing at my back; Neither princess nor pea hold weight here. Messianic, I weave a crown of thorns from the teeth of this mattress   There is no stone to be moved, nor weeping women waiting. Just  a gnawing feeling  boring at my resolve for ""rest"". I am as far from my body as my soul is to safety  A periodic push comes and though I'm beset with gloom, Duty beckons, he obliges Urging me beyond this room  I hurt, I ache, I writhe inside I break myself to stem my cries: I want to fall! I want to die! I'm never free!   And Still I Rise.  It's shift change and Sisyphus passes the baton: A cigarette, he lights and puts in it my mouth. Punctured as they are I chalk my hands   ********* if you're seeing this, thanks for giving my poem a read 💕 I hadn't earnestly written any poetry since high school but I really enjoyed this.

But behind these comforting lies  A darkness not meant to be seen  A hunger for more  A hunger to climb  A hunger through time  A hunger to survive,   A hunger to succeed  A hunger to feed  Such is the nature of this little gem:  A hunger wrapped in beauty,  A craving born to bloom,  A bittersweet desire;  A lovely little lie.  1.

Bread and Slug,loceapeace,"  I tried to speak about death. But the first thing that came to mind wasn’t death itself— it was the shape of a crushed sweet at the register, sinking into the air of a bakery about to close.  Or maybe it wasn’t bread at all. It could’ve been a scrap of cloth left after dissection, marked with a date by someone and forgotten. Left in silence, by morning, the corridor for sound was already sealed.  　  “Who betrayed that sound you believed in, first?” The question came from the wind, but the silence, weightless, had already swelled beneath the cloth. Was that even sound? The sticky residue of “not quite over” mixed with the rustling of the bag, and the warmth pressed behind a torn-off name tag.  　  Death? It was the slug’s back—half-bitten, left behind. I don’t know the definition. But a frayed edge of time, spoiled by someone’s cough, stuffed my excuses into a drawer that would never open again.  No one asked. So I’m the only one who decided that was death. Like a fake sob, recorded without name, unclaimed— and floating.  　  What is absurdity? Maybe it was the way a torn promise stuck to the bottom of a shoe sat next to a yakisoba bun’s expiry date in the middle of the night. There was never an order to speak in. Only someone who wanted one, just for that day.  　  The morning after death was drier than expected. The news didn’t arrive. The light was paralyzed. The wind handed out fake warmth. Something leftover in a bag rubbed someone’s name beneath a desk. It wasn’t the chocolate that was left behind. It was some “thing” of mine, never called, that had certainly died in a box with no one’s temperature.   ---    “Bread and Slug｜Interpretive Poem”   　  It was probably bread. But it wasn’t the filling that was crushed. It was the air that wrapped around it. Maybe I remembered it wrong. A fragment without a name was sunken by the register, and that alone still felt touchable.  　  “When did the sound break?” The question was tucked into the bag’s rustle. It wasn’t the voice of wind. But if it remained in the ear, then perhaps it was already someone else’s question. Not a reply— a tremor mistaken for response.  　  Maybe it was a slug. Maybe the back of time soaked in damp. It wasn’t connected to any sentence, but somehow it was already there. The crushed sound was never replayed. Only the warmth of its shell lingered in a corner of the box.  　  It wasn’t that the chocolate wasn’t picked up. What slipped away wasn’t a name or a feeling. It was that “something” never called, never owned, in the gap that had no temperature. Was that death? Or had we simply failed to check?  　  What is absurdity? Maybe it’s a yakisoba bun’s expiration lined up beside a half-peeled promise on the sole of a shoe— in the middle of the night. There was no proper order. Someone only believed there had to be, and tried to line them up.  　  No one asks where it was left. Still, the rustle of the crushed bag remains near the feet— as if it never left.   ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7"
Just Not Yet Dead,Remote_Green9681,"It’s 3AM.   The shadows hum.    My brain clicks on—   a loaded gun.       A film reel starts,   no need to ask.   Tonight’s feature:   my haunted past.

My Friend Ed,Responsible_Item9277," “You fat, ugly cow!” I hear inside – each bite, a blade of shame. I don’t know who the con artist is: The mirror, or my brain?  I lay in bed as Ed joins in. His whisper curls around my ear. “Let’s keep playing, darling girl.” I nod as I taste the salt of a tear.  Hi pretty girl, let’s make a deal, A bargain if you dare. Want to drop a few more pounds? It’ll only cost your hair.  Hi shrinking girl, are you happy now? Oh god – your thighs still touch! Toothpick legs are the goal. You need to skip your lunch.  Hello child, I see your ribs, Your spine could slice through skin. “Oh my Ed, are you proud?” He winks with a starving grin.  I wake up in a hospital bed. A tube shoved down my nose. Just once, can I avoid the thorns, And only get the rose?  Ed pulls me close, I nuzzle in. I savor every breath. They taste like every meal I’ve skipped, I’m cuddling my death.  Oh hey Ed, where have you been? I’ve missed your great advice. Still your girl. You always win.

Silence isn´t peaceful,Advanced-Bed1549,"A girl with no dream, no hope, no clear future. She's desperate for a clear path. Just a way -an idea- who she is meant to be. Help to find herself, her passion. She doesn't know what to do with herself. Everybody has something to do, something to spend their time doing. Everyone but her. She spends her time doing nothing and complaining about it. Everytime she starts something she never finishes it. Several unfinished projects waiting to be finished. It will never happen. She can`t bring herself to do it. It's bad for her. She criticizes herself for her laziness. It's a cycle she can not escape. Suffering in silence like she always does. She cried for help but no one heard her screams. Because she never screamed loud enough. It was like a whisper. She couldn't scream louder; she never learned how to. Every time she tried to, her voice got stuck in her throat.

The Day I Die,vazelineee,"# Will the sky cry the day I die,  Silver tears from a weary sky?   Will the earth reach out, arms wide,   And cradle me where I can hide?  Will water whisper where I lay,   Rippling soft like words I couldn’t say?   Or will I be just passing air—   A name, a face, no longer there?      Will someone pause and feel the void,   In quiet rooms we once enjoyed?   Will laughter echo down the halls,   Then hush when they recall it all?  I used to fear the ghosts at night,   Now I long for their pale light.   They seem more kind than those I’ve known,   In their silence, I feel less alone.  I’m too tired of playing parts,   Perfect daughter with a breaking heart.   Too tired of jokes with hollow sound,   Of chasing love that’s never found.  Too tired to wear this paper crown,   Of smiles forced and falling down.   Too tired of this endless fight—   Let me float into the night.  So when I go, let no one grieve,   Just let me finally... breathe.   The day I die, the storm will cease—   The day I die, I’ll be at peace.

Unspoken,JosephBensinger,"What tears the soul is not the blade,   but knowing what we chose to keep.   Regret, by softer hands conveyed,   lies buried underneath the deep.  We hoard the shards we should release,   and polish what we should forget.   Then pray for clarity or peace,   while tethered tight to old regret.  A cry is not the end of pain—   it is the mark that pain was heard.   It does not cleanse, it leaves a stain,   a message softened into word.  The ache endures because we hid   the wound too long from light and breath.   Now truth, once quiet, lifts the lid—   and love must mourn what guilt called death.  We cannot mend what will not speak,   nor heal the fault we won’t confess.   But still, the soul, though cracked and weak,   may rise beneath the weight of less.

Ashes and Flowers - At the edge of a murdered dream,SuggestionNo2556,"I remember and return to the liminal space   where the dream continues to sing:   It lingers in the yearning that    abandoned children carry in quiet rooms    and grown women still ache with in the dark.   The holy longing drenching me,   while I’ve been waiting in the window for far too long.   I still see it, hear it, seek it out,   as a punishment now, not for pleasure.  Again I stand in the gateway of the temple.    Will it collapse like so many times before?    Is the dream simply an ultimate delusion?  *Hear me speak, for a final time:*  I was the more open mirror.   The one who didn’t flinch.   The one who saw not just the dream   but the cracks beneath the surface.   And still I stayed, even after I broke.  **I saw more than you wanted me to.**   **More than I wanted to admit.**   I saw the thread, the ruin of lifetimes, *the pattern.*   It saw what it asked of me,   what it would cost me to kneel.   And still, I stayed, even after it tore me apart.  I was to stand in the cold of our winter,    wearing it like my only skin.    I survived, but the price I paid for it   was more than just blood.    It was myself and us.  You mistook worship for weakness,   and never truly looked at me    like a place where the divine might also live,    while I lit candles from my fingertips   every time your silence walked in.   You wore wounds like thrones.   Expected offerings.   Expected faith.    Expected to be seen as holy -    even as you desecrated the parts of me   that bowed too long before your absence.   You excluded me from your humanity, yet   you had the capacity for it for someone else.   I watched you give words, regret and    pieces of who I begged you to be   to another you called forever instead.   You left me in shame and ashes, with echoes.   **So, I had to blacken the mirror.**  Because it meant too much,   it hurt too much to look at a battlefield,   at ruins, to hear only silence and nothings   when there should have been everythings.  I had to turn around and unfeel,   because staying would cost even more now   than kneeling in an abandoned temple ever did.  I went to my garden and buried    what I could no longer hold.   What could never hold me back.   Sacrificed your name and the dream   and grew a field of flowers called peace.  Yet still I hear dead birds sing requiems at our grave every time I visit.    They ask:  *How does one unwant something a soul always knew as sacred?*   *How does one not abandon their own fire, when asked to return to a temple built of smoke and mirrors?*   *How does one not betray their truth, when they keep hearing their procession being held for someone else instead?*   *How does one live with the hunger, when the feast may never come?*  I cannot answer them.   I burnt too much, burnt too long,   to not stand in my own fire and truth now,   after you've burned every bridge   you could have crossed by showing   that we were not meant to be?   **This was your truth.**   The only one I couldn't accept for so long.  Things changed after I had turned to ash   and resurrected my bones from dirt.   I cannot question **your** truth anymore.   Returning to a dead dream would be   the ultimate masochistic martyrdom.  And I will not sacrifice myself for anyone anymore.   I've suffered enough for this lifetime.   The only questions I face now are:  How can I not choose the quiet path, away from you?   How can I not leave the collapsing temple and call it    an ending that I never wanted?   How can I not stop making my heart   a waiting room for someone else’s awakening?  I screamed myself hoarse for too long at the thought   of continuing this without you once more.   Because I thought the thread wouldn't lie to me this time around.   I bargained but apparently time didn't grant me a favor.  Who turned away first, whose consequences brought us here?   How can we possibly make it right at all anymore   when what remains are only ashes and flowers    that bloomed from a murdered dream?   And how can I hold it without desecrating its meaning?  Is it too late or has it been from the start?   I stand at the final crossroads,   in the recurring echo of your silence,   ready to leave us behind.   Don’t make me go.   **Just tell me, how can I stay?**  \------  ^(This is more of a work in progress.)   ^(I haven't written much at alll during the past few months. Words failed me and I needed to retreat into silence to stay sane. I tried to make sense of a lot of things lately, and this was the result of being very emotional about making one of the hardest decisions I still have to face. It's rough, it's only for those who know the flames and their song. The blame in this is just a sword telling a truth meant to be heard, nothing more. I might delete it again, so excuse my volatile nature in advance. This needed a place in the void somewhere, if only for a little while...)  ^(------)   ^(Feedback 1:) [^(The Thread Between Flame and Silence)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m35pgc/the_thread_between_flame_and_silence/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  ^(Feedback 2:) [^(We Spoke the Same Flame)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6hlzl/comment/n4r8wwc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  Thank you to u/theliminalfox  for the inspiration to revisit and speak what must be faced."
Random dream I had about my ex,c0ldf33tt,"I  I entered a serenity of fireworks and glamour,  seeing myself as one.  Faces once meant  painted in tapestries of cement.  II  I opened the door and you left,  my soul wandering.  A room of ghastly veils,  only my pulse seeks wails.  III  Banished in pavements of glass,  I lie there wondering,  will surreality last?  Naked from thorns in glades  A soul extinct in tatters of benevolence.  IV  A once inkling of stardust,  rode at once and saw  the stain of my broken glass.  You reached and absorbed,  the trance of my tears.  V  We fondled with what was,  the hare of my child  sprinting in glow of your hands.  VI  You illuminate,  but only for dawn.

Perhaps Another Pair of Eyes,Old-Designer-2260,"Hi everyone!    I've shared a few poems here before, but since English isn’t my first language, I’m still really curious to know how my writing comes across to native readers.    For me, writing poetry feels like an experiment—a kind of language game. But sometimes I worry that I lose touch with that direct, intuitive emotional impact.    So please feel free to share your honest impressions. Do the poems make sense to you? Do they evoke anything meaningful or enjoyable?    I'd love to hear how you experience them. Looking forward to your thoughts!      # Perhaps Another Pair of Eyes      Outside, the branches are bare.    The birdsong comes    from my lover’s phone.    I close my eyes, trying to picture    the hue of its feathers—    but such imagining is vain.        There have been many times.    that I have filled a blank screen    with shortcuts—    and in the same way,    faced the hollowed-out room,    seeking the world    at the end of a wire.      “See you, love,”    she says—    and my side folds in.    Absurd.      I gaze at the bare branches,    searching the leaden sky for something.    The distant woods freeze like oil paint.    Cars sleep along the roadside.      Perhaps another pair of eyes    peeks out behind a curtain,    waiting for the same wings    to pass above this block.

Your Voice Bellowed Through the Veil,theliminalfox,"I heard your voice.   It bellowed through the veil.   You called me   to watch your internal world fracture   for me to bear witness   to the words I etched   into time itself,   for the thread to pull   and disprove   everything   you believed   about yourself.    I saw the men, armed,   entering a tall cathedral   engulfed in flame.   Shattering beliefs tied   to an old world,   to an old version   of you   exorcising everything in their path   beliefs bound in shadow   before setting alight   your home.   A second cleansing.   A final exorcism.    I called out:   “Save the cats.”   A plea   for you   not to destroy   your innocence   the boy,   the man,   who buried   the true parts   of himself,   who hid,   disguised,   wearing a face   that wasn’t his,   and buried softness   to survive.    When my soul   returned to body   I felt it.   The weight   in my chest.   The ache.   The grief.   I did not tremble.   I did not break.   I carried it.   I stayed.    You made it through   fractured   not untouched,   but ready   to rebuild   yourself   in truth.    Now?

My Candle,Slow-Artist1786," My Candle I met an old woman today.  I sat by her bed, held her hands  What’s your story? Why are you here?  She looked at me.  With love in her eyes   Little life left in her smile  Like you.  I was young once,   Beautiful, vibrant,    The world my canvas.   Now I'm tattered, torn and alone.  You see the passage of time.  Has not been the greatest of healer.  And my story.  I cannot say, not yet anyway.  So go,  come back again someday.   As I walked away.  I felt her pain.  Reflected in my eyes, in my heart.   You don’t know my story,    Someday you may, she said    But for now, I am not minister of my tales.  It is mine to tell ... Yes.  If I choose to tell it.  Like a lighted candle.

For art is not enough to grant the knowledge of who wakes and who sleeps.

"How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 4",zyerhod1,"**How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 4**   *(1966–1969)*   by Bryon Slack  We lit the match in Watts in '65   but called it theirs when the city burned.   We blamed tempers, not the tinder—   not the cops who beat Marquette Frye,   not the poverty, not the smog-thick ceilings   pressing down on families penned by red lines   we drew ourselves.   We called it a riot.   We knew it was Wrath.   And rage knows every boarded window by name.  We sent troops into Newark in '67   after cops killed John Smith   and dumped his broken body   into a precinct basement,   like they were storing evidence   to solve who'd done it.   We told the world we were restoring order—   as if order isn't something   we manufacture daily.  We shot Detroit into silence   with tanks and rifles on 12th Street,   after we'd zipped up the last bag   we called it a rebellion.   43 dead.   Hundreds injured.   Thousands arrested.   But the real number was deeper—   in homes burned,   in trust shattered,   in the echo of our own soldiers   marching through broken neighborhoods   we were never going to rebuild.  We could have fixed it with Kerner’s words:   ""This is our nation, moving toward two societies—   one black, one white—separate and unequal.""   But we shelved the report.   Defunded the programs.   Blamed the victims... again...   Because reckoning was too close to repentance,   and repentance required change.  By 1968, we were nervous.   King was still marching.   Too many of us were listening now.   Then Memphis, another strike.   Garbage workers holding signs   just to say they were human.   And the bullet found King.   And we found new ways to justify the noise.  We gave him a holiday   but not the justice he died demanding.   We clipped his quotes,   diluted his fire,   made him safe for school assemblies.   We teach peace,   but never the part   where he told us peace without justice   was just quiet oppression.   A Hallmark card of polite protest.  Then cities burned again—   not just one, but more than a hundred.   Washington. Chicago. Kansas City.   We looted them first—of opportunity,   of fairness, of air, of safety—   and then we wept   when they returned the favor   in flames and fury.  We were scared of their anger   but never our own apathy, so...   We kept pushing.  By the time the Panthers showed up armed   in Sacramento’s statehouse,   we called it terrorism—   because our fear   has always been louder than their grief.   Even when they fed kids,   even when they built clinics,   even when they tried to do   what we never would.  We had a choice.  To listen.   To rebuild.   To take responsibility   before the ledger filled with names   we’d never bother to read in full.  But we made the same choice we always do.  And when the next bullets flew,   we made sure the barrels turned inward   at a young unifier in Chicago.   Because we knew what was coming.   Because we knew   they’d finally learned to reload.  **Feedback:**   [""Inheritance""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6orm1/comment/n4ln4se/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""A Lesson in Vulnerability for a Fish""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6hcez/comment/n4lobff/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

Singular flux,Ok_Manufacturer_195,"I have spent so long viewing myself as nothing but trash I don’t know how to see more than the broken bits I was left with.  I hate almost every part of me, while trying to reshape what the world demanded I be. They said I was worthless, unlovable, not enough and somehow, too much all at once.  I’ve known love. I’ve lost it too. And each time it slipped away, I wondered if the world was right.  When my mind turns into a bell tolling every failure, every echo I’ve been fed “You were supposed to be special,” then later, “You’re fat, worthless, not man enough, not rich enough.”  No one stops to ask what that does to someone.  It made me small. Smaller than my six-foot-one frame, smaller than the space I take up just a few inches of soul curled inside a dark corner, trying not to be a burden.  The burn-out. The fuck-up. The waste of space.  But I try.  Maybe that’s why bonds break, why people drift, why I still fear I’ll never have a family to hold, a love that stays. Maybe I’m built to live in singular flux spinning in place, just out of reach of something whole.  But I’m still here. And I still try. And maybe that matters more than I’ve let myself believe.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/HMqOPnSanM  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/zc3OeTNdis"
Looking for feedback on coursework,taflad,"Hi all,  I'm looking to get some feedback on some poems I recently submitted for a course I am taking and the returned commentary on the submission. I'm asking as I genuinely thought that these poems we're to the best of my ability. Is the commentor correct? Do they not illicit any appeal to any senses? I'm not looking for validation on the work, just to see if the commentary is fair       If this is not allowed here, my apologies.  Poem 1:  **The life worth lived**     Growing older, no escape  My younger self, losing shape  Losing hair, and that’s the truth  My youth now just a dreamscape     Once, I was a young man, true  Experience to accrue  Never doing as I should  Manhood, yet to make debut     A dad at just seventeen  The future yet still unseen  Just a boy, feeling moonstruck  I was stuck somewhere between     Then In a blur, came girl two  And a marriage, that came too!  Children, to which I’m curator  Family to cater to     4 years on, another child  Life’s rollercoaster gone wild  Life flew by, I felt, forsooth  Feeling like youth’s exiled     Three more orbits ‘round the sun  Another child, this, a son  Family complete, I sigh  He’s to be our final one     Forty now, no ambition  Lost passion and cognition  Nostalgia, a heavy load  On the road to perdition     But it hasn’t all been bad  Theres been more happy than sad  Through life, we’ve wanted for nigh  For my family, I’m glad     We’ve built home and family,  We’re together, come what be  Our lives now not on standby  The future, I can’t wait to see  Poem 2:  **Cogs**     Work hard! Work Hard!  Punch clock or card  Never be bard  Live through the grind     Knees gone? Bad back?  Work or get sacked  Stay on their track  And from their mind     Middle aged yet?  tougher it gets  that is no threat  our world defined     sixty-five now  got here, some how  still a cash cow  life left behind     time for the grave  try to be brave  whole life, enslaved  you won’t be pined  Poem 3:  **Her ballad**     On a mountain, all alone  Far above the city drone  Through the trees, the wind did moan  He stayed and waited for her     Long ago and far away  In a place he could not stay  Both turned into love’s cliché  He said that he’d wait for her     No word from her for many years  And love turned into bitter tears  His biggest hopes turned into fears  And still he waited for her     Seventeen long years went by  Everyday he’d wait and sigh  “Why, oh Why, did my love lie?”  I shouldn’t have waited for her     As the cold wind chilled his core  And with the pain that he had bore  He longed to feel the hurt no more  No longer he’d wait for her     From the mountain he did leap  As if a man in a deep sleep  Now in a grave, 6 feet deep  He wished she’d waited for him  The commentary I had to write  My first poem tried to be an example of a Welsh poetry form called Englyn Cyrch. This form is defined by using 4 lines, 7 syllables per line. There is a rhyming scheme where lines 1,2 and 4 rhyme and then line 3 rhymes with a syllable of a word somewhere in the middle of the last line. This was a great challenge that I very much enjoyed. I used my personal life to create this poem. The tight structure really meant that I had to be careful with what I say without compromising the theme. I spent about 4 days rewriting this, trying different rhyming words and trying to fit them into the strict syllable limit.     My 2^(nd) poem is another Welsh form poem called Rhupunt. This form relies on rules that say:  * Each line or stanza contains 3 to 5 sections * Each section has 4 syllables * All but the final section rhyme with each other * The final section of each line or stanza rhymes with the final section of the other lines or stanzas     This was also a very fun challenge. It again relied on a very strict format, and this one took around 3 days for me to fully complete. Although still a personal view, I wanted this to appeal to the readers sense of work in the modern world. I found it a little easier to write because I didn’t have to make it so personal. Again, I enjoyed the tight restrictions of the form, and I have learned that I can make some poetry with such tight restrictions. This has opened up a whole field of poetry that I wasn’t aware of     For my final poem, I wanted to initially write a fun limerick, but after learning about the limits put on them, I decided to write in a more free form style. I’ve tried to keep the sing-song quality of a limerick, but the theme isn’t a fun one. As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to originally write a story for this, so I decided to write out a plot line that I had been playing with and turn it into a poem. This poem was all fiction and I was able to still tell a fictional story whilst keeping with my choice of poetry for this EMA. I had a lot of fun writing the outline for this, using words that fit the narrative but also maintained the limerick-like flow.  The feedback received (this is verbatim, spelleing mistakes are genuine)  || || |Comments on your creative writing| |The poems in this EMA do not very effectively draw on the rich possibilities of language and any appeal to the five senses of the reader remains at a somewhat undeveloped level. There is a fairly unusual rhynng scheme in the first poem and this adds a little brio but the arguments tend to be couched in very abstract language. 'Cogs' is a stronger and terser poem but 'Her ballad' suffers from poeticising inversion as well as ungrammatical language (ie 'the pain that he had bore' - this should read 'borne'). |  || || |Comments on your commentary| |The commentary is wrongly set in single spacing though prose for this module is supposed to be set in double spacing. Thogh there are a few quite well made arguments the commentary generally ignores the course materials, does not use quotations from any of them in support and does not provide a bibliography.  |    Many thanks in advance  Feedback:       [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6fmvj/comment/n4ok6fs/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6fmvj/comment/n4ok6fs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)     [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6xcnj/comment/n4ojorr/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6xcnj/comment/n4ojorr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Front Page / Back Yard,cosmic_nuggets_,"Emaciated, malnourished infant on the front page. And I’m suddenly, arrestingly engaged in conversation With someone, Who’s concerned about the size of my coffee.  Seized by a foul odour round the back of my house. Putrid. My voice is hoarse. Everybody is blinded. Vacuous. Vapid. Banal. The pointed place where meaning absconds. Trapped by inability To articulate.  Cleave humanity of its joints. The erasure of concern. I’m safe in my modern box. I’m safe in my crematorium.       Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/rsI99kp7CL  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/DnjMXpfgoI"
Death: an old friend,Raee_lovelorn_poet,"Everything I reached for left echoes in my ribcage, hollow songs in place of heartbeats. I bled into the cup of hope like a sinner still believing that wine could be made from pain. every gulp a lie I told myself: ""Maybe this time, it’ll be enough.""  Shaky hands, knelt at the altar of what-ifs— the gods long gone, The cold tiles beneath my knees know me better than anyone ever did, and my prayers heavy like rusted chains around my throat, half breathless from the silence that swallowed every word.  I begged for death— not the kind that comes quiet in sleep, but one that walks in wearing the face of someone who once stayed. A familiar hand cupping my cheek as if to say, ""You’ve mourned enough. Come home, love. Come home.""  Maybe then, I'd finally get to hold someone without apologizing for the weight I bring. Maybe then, the cracks in me wouldn’t be punished for leaking too much love.  I’m tired. My soul is tired. Of stitching smiles for others while letting myself bleed beneath.  Love and I never truly met— We were always just two strangers walking opposite streets. I waved. It never looked back.  So if I go— let it be into arms that know what it means to stay. Let death be the first to truly hold me.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/8t3EraK2N6 https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NWHZWffYOp"
Ache,ew_ell,"Hi, this is my first poem being shared on this forum or in general. You can rip me apart in the comments as you wish. This to me is about the feeling of waking up from a dream of someone who used to tear your insides apart, forward and backwards. But still feeling their soft touch before you wake up. Someone you know deeply but will forever onward be strangers to.   Confession—it’s comfort, like memory.   I’ll trace your heat with tender hands, wiping sweat off my brow.   Incandescent, but detached, insistent on distance.   It’s futile memory, inconsistent; romanticizing murmurs of returned desire. Seeing stars that could never catch you, only tighten their grip, suffocating devotion.   Memories erode and fall at your feet: flaking skin, bleeding raw love.   Sharpening claws between teeth.   Still, scratching so softly.   Memory is confession, when you finally wake up.

Storybook,PringlesCat2,"(A bit of inspiration from ""Sonic and the Black Knight.)  Life is a mysterious tale   Full of twists and turns and plot holes that make no sense.   I was content… for a while, but then I asked myself:  *“Where’s the magic?”*   *“Where’s the finesse?”*   *“Where’s the compelling heroes and villains that make this story worth reading?”*  So I sat and waited…   And waited…   And waited…   Till my hands decided they couldn’t wait any longer.  With a swift flash of my pen, I began writing.   The maelstrom of madness   Whirling around in my head could finally be put to paper.  A hero, charming and courageous. A shining beacon of hope to all.   A villain, cunning and dastardly, with world domination in his sights.   The plot was profound, the action was amazing   The fighting was ferocious, the characters were colorful.   It was my magnum opus.  I gazed upon my completed art in awe; my eyes welled up with tears.   It was as if God himself had written a biblical masterpiece   A world between worlds that mere mortals could barely comprehend.   Every time I’d take a stroll through the landscape   My happy ending would always come true.  Yet, even in heaven, a sense of dread and despair   Had hidden where I couldn’t find them.   I thought I had cast out any possible monsters from my sanctuary   That demons wouldn’t slip through the gates and burn down my will.   I was looking down at a hell fast approaching.  I made copies as quickly as reality would allow.   Everyone, absolutely **EVERYONE** had to see this.   Online and in-person, I managed to spread my wings   Before waiting with giddy anticipation.  It was awful.   Truly, utterly, horrific.   The people were speaking, but they spoke with venom-laced tongues   Mixed with arctic hearts of tungsten.  *“Lazy.”*   *“Uninspired.”*   *“Ridiculous.”*   *“Boring.”*   *“Amateur.”*  They pointed to cracks I couldn’t see   Played tapes of silence I couldn’t hear   Repeated my work in incomprehensible incantations I wouldn’t dare utter.  It was impossible.   Improbable.   Illogical.   There were no flaws, just blessings in disguise   That no one bothered to look into.  I screened every word   Scanned every event   Scoured each nook and cranny of plains and castles   To find anything, *anything* that was *“wrong.”*   I came up empty.  Empty threats, empty jeers, empty inside.   Is this how my story ends?  No. Not even close.  I’ve poured **blood**   I’ve poured **sweat**   I’ve poured **tears**   I’ve poured **years**   I’ve **screamed**, and I’ve **cried**   I’ve **toiled**, and I’ve **tried**   I’ve **chained**, and I’ve **choked**   I’ve **downed**, and I’ve **smoked**   I’ve hit **start**, I’ve hit **stop**   I have **worked** till I **dropped**   I’ve poured **life**, I’ve poured **death**   And I’ll be **DAMNED** if I’m at the end with nothing left.  Some may say that a good story knows when to end   That a life isn’t good if it goes on forever.   To that, I shake my head and chuckle.   Even though a deus ex machina came in and almost ruined it all   My happy little ending will be far, far away…  Far away…   Out of sight…   Out of mind…   Now that’s a story worth reading.

The wake of love,AdorableAnything4964," Now begins a new wake of darkness.  You’ve watched it die a 100 times-each searing your soul with a primal grief.  You feel the loss as you sit in the silence of the waiting days.    Isn’t the loss of love the same as a loss of a loved one?  You attend the wake-hoping against hope that it’s not the final goodbye.  Hoping that you got it wrong.  Hoping that you will see them smile and hug your terrors away.     The new days of darkness is a person dying in a pine box.  You feel love around you dim.  You listen to voices fade.  Screaming in your thoughts “I’m still here!”.  You want to wake from your wooden bed.  You want to tell him, “I am still here.  I love you still.”.  But, it’s a wake.  You know your place.  You wait and you hope and you dream because it’s all you can do.   You die in the deafening silence, but you never can let go.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/DpsRnERBiK  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Wd9q6kUCto"

Thought I would share! :)   I wish I could write how I think  I think so much but by the time I go to write the thoughts all fade  If I could write how I thought I would write about every second of every day  But I cannot for some reason get a single thought to stay  For by the time I go to write all my thoughts shall fray  So I sit and I pray that hopefully someday my thoughts will cease to fray at least long enough that I can make them stay  For at least long enough they can live just one more day  My thoughts are like treasure, buried so deep to stay that when they come to surface their worth has worn away  No matter how much I shine them they’ll never be like new   For they grew in the dirt barely into view   Some grow in clusters others just a few   however, no matter how many, they always work in queue   So I can wish I could write how I think but that will never become true for by the time I go to write my thoughts whittle down to just two    Comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/aTCzsmSQKl  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/dWY2iWOzD5"
Wound,WebEuphoric9382," In her youth she would have had   all the ships of creation launch themselves   into the vicious maelstrom of the storm   to land on the shores of her captivity.   Bristling with the warriors that obsession   drove to meet their ends in that distant land.   /  But now, a lifetime cocooned  in the Ward – the love song of her heartbeat  echoes off the sterility of tile. White  spaces on walls reflecting that off-yellow.  Which begs to be the canvas of her Art  so that witness can be made and be left.  /  A wonder that in this End,  as family claws the pane glass outside,  as all Time crescendos, and crashes down,  the Rites are performed by a soldier, not nurse.  Whose party launched themselves into this place  to serve as sentry and take meek action.  /  Where once but soft slipper tread  now boots, and sinew made iron for violence.   Not one-thousand ships but one-hundred souls  descend, as if a Virus can be a jailer.  There is no cannon, no rifle, no war  and no key. No way to open this place           to the rest of the World. /  And as I write, memory  of our country’s common wound joins itself  to all of the grief that fills those empty  spaces within a soul; borne of loss and war.  Your face joins others, old and young – burnt black,  that rip apart these quiet moments     forcing me to bandage these wounds again.     Feedback:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/kDQWoV6BJZ  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Qzu4pdUOkL    "
When you meet your soulmate a few souls too late.,Featherman13," When you meet your soulmate a few souls too late.  ×××××××××××××××××××  When I first see you time won't slow down  My brain won't go numb trying to think of how ill tell you my name  When we first meet I won't make you laugh  My focus won't be on tricking your lips into a smile  When we first kiss there won't be fireworks or butterflies  My butterflies have been swatted away by nets I'd trusted over them  And my fireworks are buried under a hundred faulty matches  When we celebrate that first anniversary I won't be in love  My love has been crushed, picked for spare parts and tossed away when they rusted  But the sound of your voice drops sweet lime on that rust, your nails in my hair cracks its shell, and your hand on my chest keeps me still enough for you to pick it off a piece at a time  Still it grows on every part, flooding to fill the void your brief absences leave in me  It's turned my mind into a weapon and aimed the barrel back at you   And the naked feeling of armor shattering at your touch makes my skin cold  And that chill reminds me of the fear all my rust stood between  And your touch starts to feel like hers  Your words sound almost like hers  My feelings for you boil into hate for her  That heat keeps me warm while my frostbite spreads to you  And when you're hands shiver my chest falls loose  And your nails don't crack the shell they only scar it  And your voice feels more like salt than sweet lime  I don't believe you when you say you won't hurt me   Words of comfort set off blaring sirens  The love you give is guzzled down to keep my heart above water  Then it's given back rotten and used  But as time goes less and less is given back  So you hold onto that old rotten love  And you stretch it and squeeze it and pretend it's enough for you  You pretend it's what you always wanted  Soon enough that rot has spread and you're out of good love to give  I took it all and left without rot or rust  I left with a heart full of warmth you lit with your last match   And when you first meet your soulmate time won't slow down  You won't make him laugh  There won't be fireworks or butterflies  You won't be in love  I crushed that love, picked it for spare parts, and tossed them away when they rusted   Links:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/C6s4dT5Jg5  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ItWoBLO0VI   "
January 17th,WebEuphoric9382,"Two bombs went off during our call together.  The first, your cancer, and the second  that drone which arced its ancient hate  across the city bordering my small outpost.  /  It was in those bleeding lands where I reconnected  to your lessons. The quiet, private, moments   where the first Man I was to know equipped-me  with all the knowledge of his immense Universe –   /  filled with space voyages of starship Enterprise  and seldom used epithets, even by the Boomers.  Those moments where your calloused embrace  Soothed every loss, every heartbreak, every fear.  /  I cauterized the wound of your Final News  as I examined the severed artery of a Peshmerga –   imploring his comrade through staccato speech  to wait. To allow me to throw my gloved hand  /  into the violence of his upper thigh. So I might  make time. Time I wasn’t sure we would have.  Where I could unpack all your secrets. Lessons   learned through the perfection of your fatherhood.  /  I tried to understand your weight, gravity, in my life –   “why does your Love for mom eclipse any love  I have felt? What is the secret imbued by quiet  confidence that so connects two souls”? Or,  /  “where do I find the same complete, total, happiness  you found? Raising such ‘different beasts’, children.  Who shot themselves into the World on such divergent  paths, grounded by your celebration of their journeys”.  /  On January 17th I thrust myself into the nightmare  of the Dizayee home. Disarticulating the violence   which with calloused purpose transited the nap of the sky  to murder a child as she was embraced by her father.  /  As you once embraced me. And a year later I held your hand.  Trying to commit, to thrust myself, into that Final Goodbye.  Knowing that my words would choke themselves out  in the space between my teeth; that all I could do was  /  throw my calloused palm into yours, and offer that  confident embrace I learned from you. Hoping,   that in your quietness, you felt your son’s promise.  To one day, after my war was over, see you again.     Comments:  1. https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/LGdwwtru9R 2. https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/s8lvhZ4DPc"
Counted Voices of Blame,loceapeace,"  　  Around the memory that was never called, only the blinking light stroked a frayed presence. The folded gesture stuck as it was, unnamed, handed off just before sound to another back.  　  A certain warmth was left out to dry. Not because it couldn’t reach— but because the silence was bound to prevent touch, rolling as it peeled murky skin. In a room that allowed only one shape, a rubbed-in touch blurred the edges of vision.  　  That night, a seat collapsed. Inside a lie called “record,” only the vacant heat, sealed with blurred reverberations, remained. What slipped across my mouth wasn’t a voice, but a series of murmurs tracing the path of my utterance.  　  A kindness without shelter was mixed into the fabric of neglect. The outline of a tongue, wrapped in cling film’s tacky chill. No name was given to the heat of the tear, only a question left misaligned from the reading: “Whose voice did you bite into?” Traces of guilt stuck to someone’s collar, and a laugh, still frayed, sank into the margin stitched shut with bone.  　  Peeling rejections settled into backs. The residue of uniforms tore at the shoulder. Those who lined up the broken responses tossed them all away— throat and all. —Who swallowed that silence first?  　  It hadn’t ended. It had merely been folded, masquerading as kindness, and shelved in someone else’s closet.  　  Between fleeing and never returning, only a shed agreement, still wet, kept bouncing sound back from behind the wall. The next morning, breath alone was granted, and unnamed counted voices continued behind the wall.   ---    Counted Voices of Blame｜Interpretive Response Poem  　  Voices weren’t born to count. They were assigned to decide who gets to stay silent.  　  Around the peeled tongue, kindness refused to be sorted. Only blank spaces, meant for records, were stored deep inside the shelf.  　  When someone’s question was bitten, its response had already collapsed. It was never meant to arrive— just to be folded in advance.  　  That silence took the form of an unspoken consent and slipped, every morning, into the light.  　  Even now, never reaching any mouth, the “pretense of kindness” remains folded.  And someone’s voice, belonging to no one, still counts, from behind the wall, the order in which silence was swallowed.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7"

As It Is.,GameMythYT,"The outer may reflect the inner,   but mirrors too must be made clean.  One can wear the robes of truth,   One can wear the mouth and hands of law,   and still speak in riddles that obscure its truthfulness.  The trustworthy are not those who shine,   but those whose structure holds under pressure.   Unbreakable under scrutiny, but still falsifiable endlessly so.  I do not speak from the mountain,   but from the dust where language breaks.  Truth may begin within,   but can it be proven in absolute?  Through epistemic skepticism?   Through cosmological skepticism?   Through religious skepticism?  I challenge all, dare to break my framework and witness its potential:  The moral mind is not a mask of gold,   but a grammar of fractures.   Not to crown the speaker,   but to measure the space between belief and being.  If your trust rests only in those without flaw,   then trust no human, and speak only with silence.  \-Jackson T. Kagan-Lenz (me)   Context: I invented a philosophical framework that I believe is world-changing and revolutionary in ethics called Happeningism which is basically the tool Nietzche wished philosophies would admit to, formalized. Through an argument between a skeptic-turned-understood, I utilized poetic language, and I crafted this poem.

Another love poem,Plenty_Mistake_9577,"When I was young love was so free,    The soul consuming kind they talked about in TVD,   Head up in the clouds   a euphoria surrounding me.   Day dreaming about my lover - how blissful life will be.    But now that I am older I can't find that feel.   Cause now love comes with unkept promises and receipts.    Or maybe i dont know what love is truly like,   Cause why is it that all great love stories ends with someone dying?   Is it that love bleeds from the same dull knife?  Is love even real or some illusion of our mind ?   I wish I could tell you but I truly don't know,   I only know how to dream of love that have a soul soothing flow.    I want love that feels like a landscape of fireflies ,  Someone who gives me space and a reason to smile.   A person whose world doesn't revolve around me,   The one who sees poetry in worn down sheds and tragedy.    A love so kind that I wear it like honour,   The feeling of home in a person , not some corner.   Will this love find me or stay in this word play?   Will I just float or reach my shore someday?

Devour Me Softly,KonradCurzeIsMyDaddy,"Wrote this randomly earlier, first thing I posted on this sub. (ADDING THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A HEALTHY VIEW ON LOVE) -  Love is the slow kind of hunger.  Not the kind that gnaws,  the kind that lingers in the mouth  like the taste of someone's skin  hours after they're gone.   You look at me like a meal  and I don't flinch.  If anything,  I inch closer.  Invite you in.  Offer you the parts  I should protect.   This isn't romance.  It's a ritual.  The quiet agreement  that we will ruin each other beautifully,  with teeth,  with longing,  with the terrible need  to be known so fully  it borders on consumption.   You take from me,  not everything,  just enough to leave me aching.  And I let you.  Because love, in the end,  is just a slow devouring  where we call it devotion  when we really mean  feed me.  -  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Qv1Fxgg9Ee https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/MHG7bOAoq9"
Hairball,A-letter_to-Ove,"This nagging— a wad of hair burrowed in the hollow of my stomach.  It lingers— not pain, not hunger, just a weight where there was once nothing.  I cough— not to silence it but to simmer, to listen.  It bellows— a hand I can’t push away drawing me forward as if it’s been growing with me.  It was never foreign. Patient in my ignorance— no longer waiting, but pressing.  I clasp— not to control it but to surrender to what I grew blindly.  - Blake Raccuglia  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/P2qxF4QxJH  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/bKNsIWjbDg"

Breakfast time now:    It’s toast today—   Baby’s new tooth   Goes straight to work.    Dog begs from behind,   Baby turns and laughs,   She shares; he’s pleased.    I savor and breathe.     Inhale.    It’s peanut butter,   Lemon-scented cleaner.    Exhale.    Table crumbs,   Dadadas,    And baby gulps.    But just when did she get so good    With her cup?    Birds sing on the other side   Of the glass.    We clean up and listen    To pop music on vinyl   Before we have our    Morning nap.    Splash pad later,   Then a bath.    Maybe salmon for dinner.     Inhale.    Exhale.    Watch the dancing leaves,    Bright, glimmering, green,    Leaves from my winter dreams.    Too soon they will fall;   I savor and breathe.

I’ll take away your joy, your purpose, and your clarity.  I’ll let you suffer. I’ll do what it takes to bring you home to me.  Yes, that’s it. Now bring your lips to me. Inhale me with your spirit, feel your worries slip away. I’ll cherish you for now, I’ll soothe all your tension from today.  We’ll spend all our days together, in the midst of the anguish we create.  I see your heart. I see your resistance— though I don’t quite understand it. When I came to you, you were broken. You said you wanted to fix it.  I gave you all my joy— and now you show me resistance?!  That’s it! I’ve had it!  I’ve tolerated your insolence— now you will taste my wrath.  I’ll take back all my gifts. I’ll leave you restless and desperate. You’ll beg to have me back.  I’ll take away your family. I’ll take away your time. I’ll take away your integrity. I’ll take every last dime. I’ll take away your beauty. All your self respect.  I’ll take everything you cherish, and even then you’ll still come back.  I won’t let up on you. I won’t let you breathe.  I’ll keep checking up on you.  Even as you sleep.  Know you can never escape me.  My codependent friend.  I’ll take everything away from you, even your last breath.   No one here can save you.   No one can understand.   I’ll label you as mine and be with you until the end.   Now hush my dear, be quiet. No don’t even make a peep.

The flower that died with the poem,Due-Presentation3959,"The Flower That Died With the Poem  Narrator: A dried flower pressed inside a love letter.  I once bloomed in the hush of a vow, Clipped from springtime’s trembling brow. Not to thrive, but to be kept Between two lines where silence slept.  No soil to root, no sky to crave, I lived as beauty mourns the brave. A crimson prayer on parchment sewn, A wilted witness, pressed and alone.  They placed me there with trembling grace, Inside a verse a sacred place. Not for color, not for scent, But for the love the letter meant.  And oh, that ink it sang her name, It bled like dusk, it burned like flame. The poet’s hand, the lover’s sin, Etched every ache I carry within.  I’ve heard the ache in every word, The softest sorrow ever heard. Where longing curled in curling script, And time, unmoved, just watched it slip.  They say I’m lovely, a keepsake thing, But I am rot with a borrowed wing. A relic locked in lines unread, A myth of love that long since fled.  I heard the drawer creak once at dawn, The book was opened, eyes were drawn But not to me. They turned the page, Unmoved by all my quiet rage.  The ink had faded, but I remained, Like whispered guilt, unnamed, unclaimed. And still I lie in twilight's fold, A broken bloom with a heart of gold.  Love is not light it is pressed and still, A hymn half-sung, a willful will. It does not dance, it does not burn It waits in silence, waits to return.  I am not death, nor am I dream, I am the pause between the seams Where touch once lingered, then withdrew, And left behind a crimson clue.  I do not bloom, I do not break, I hold what even gods forsake The memory of a love confessed, And folded back into the rest.  I envy ashes, swift and sure, Their pain is brief, their death is pure. But I decay in threads of grace, Forgotten in a lover’s place.  I smell of longing, I taste of dust, A pressed-down promise, a breathless trust. She loved him once that much I know, I felt it in the way I froze.  And now the poem sleeps, unread, The paper curled, the meaning fled. But I still here beneath the prose A godless flower no one chose.  So should you find me, soft and frail, Let not my silence seem so pale. For I have known what love once said, When all it touched was almost dead.  ""Even beauty, when caged, forgets how to breathe.""  Time, watching over a letter that never lived.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/uaLmckFrhU  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/r6MDbFt8LQ"

Your Storm Killed the Me That Was,zyerhod1,"**Your Storm Killed the Me That Was**   *by Bryon Slack*  My love for you died   a death of a thousand cuts   in the darkness between   a thousand lights of gas   and the motion   of a thousand shifts in blame.  It died not fast, but slow,   in ways foretold I now know—   you rewrote my reality   and wrapped it in a cheap plastic bow.  What began as romance   curdled into recognition:   that every word,   every reaction,   would be twisted,   used against me   without even being Mirandized.  Recognition begat revilement,   and in quiet revulsion,   my heart began to sing   its song of resistance,   retaliation, and reckoning.  I didn’t know why,   at the time,   that every conversation   with you made me feel   like a cage door had just   slammed shut and a bell had rung.  But I knew, by the end,   I was always struggling to breathe,   to remember myself,   to trust my own perception.  Seven years I let you win—   you set the terms   of my relationship with my own children.  Seven years I gathered   the scattered pieces of me   from where I’d been scorched   to the bedrock by your lies,   burned down by every   flying monkey sent my way,   every old friend who believed   your deceit over decades of   knowing me,   every projection of your every flaw.  But I picked them up,   piece by piece,   learning each brick by name   and placing it with purpose   in my new House of Self—   unshakeable   by the would-be slitherings   of future snakes.  You destroyed me—   cast the flaming tatters   of what I was   into an exultant sky.  But what remains now   is only what Truth left:   raw and real,   a purer self—   a distillation,   an unshakeable new foundation   that will never again   ignore pennants   planted in crimson cloth.  **Feedback:**   [""Ancient Sun""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6cly7/comment/n4ipg62/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""Trenches""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m66c6r/comment/n4iqh8q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
The Weight Of Water,PoetryCharm,"He wakes with salt caught in his throat On the seabed near a broken boat. Amidst the dark, he barely sees— His face is streaked with silent pleas.  He tries to move, but all in vain, His limbs held fast by chains of pain. He thrashes hard to free his frame, Still clutching guilt he cannot name.  He pleads, he cries, he shouts and yelps, Hoping someone, somewhere helps. But he’s too deep beneath the sun, Where light can’t reach—not even one.  His mind unravels, he's a mess, Still tangled in unspoken stress. Ensnared again by shadows' chain, Though every breath resists the pain.  The fear returns—it always stays. But this time, he will face the maze. His eyes ignite with fierce, pure light— A will to live, a need to fight.  He looks up as a hand breaks through The murky veil, steady and true. The chains dissolve into the sea, And for the first time—he feels free.  The hand pulls with a silent vow, Lifting him from the darkness now. No sound is made, no words are shown, But even the drowning can rise alone.  He kicks, he climbs, and gasps for air— The ocean fades, the weight still there. But now he knows he’s not unknown— That even the lost can find their own.  I would love to hear what you think about this poem based on the emotional heaviness we all carry.

The Darkest shade of red,Ellie_Williams897,"The darkest shade of red is not from roses, nor from wine's reluctant pour. It bleeds from wounds that never close, from love that left a hollow core.  At 6 A.M., the fire sighs, half-alive in the old brick hearth. Your photo curls beneath the light, a ghost still glowing from its birth.  I should save it. I should care. But I don't. Or maybe I do. I want to see the flames consume what once was me what once was you.  I loved you hard enough to crack, to split my soul along the seam. But pride spoke louder than the truth, and love dissolved into a dream.  Now half of me is granite still, the other half still wet with grief. Time, the liar, keeps me waiting, stretching pain without relief.  They said, “You’ll heal,” but healing lies in letting go I never did. Regret still whispers through the years, a shadow I can’t keep hid.  The fire plays upon your face, your eyes, still watching as I burn. Flowers bloom from fractured stone, but never ask for love’s return.  I reach but ash is all that’s left, a piece of you, a piece of me. You took it when you turned away, or maybe when I set you free.  The darkest shade of red is not just blood  it’s words unsaid, the love we missed. It stains the spaces where we stood, and colors every “what if” kiss.  Comments 1.https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/8wOsiUYIVG 2.https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/imli1mObi1"
Stepping out from under you,carnageandeuphoria,"Looking for feedback I worry my writing leans a bit flimsy-like it’s trying to be loud and subtle at the same time and ends up not fully landing either. I aim for emotional intensity without being too on-the-nose, but I’m not sure if that balance is working.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/oklhKy01Fl https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/qXIQJvcTcj  Stepping out from under you  feels like shedding a layer of myself-  peeling back skin  to find the dust-covered parts  I buried  for you.  It’s disorienting,  the expanse of your own self  when it’s no longer tied to someone else.  Who am I,  when you’re not watching?  my practiced steps stumble,  two left feet  Desperately searching for rhythm  now that I’ve slipped  out of sync with your relentless beat  Still, your echoes speak louder than I do.  I didn’t even have to think  when I was choosing for two.  Or really   now I can wonder  was I only ever choosing for you?  I pause -  Ask-  Is this me?  Or just muscle memory,  Only flexed by silence  that spoon-fed my missteps  from your silver path?  Do I like this colour?  Or am I reaching for something  that fits your palette  of muted tones?  Freedom is here-  waiting.  But I wasn’t ready  for my trembling grasp  as I took her hand.  Who am I,  when I’m no longer trying  to be palatable?"
THE FADING TEXTURES OF HUNGER,nagamidge,"Eleven summers dance in Yasmin’s bones,   A spark unquenched by Gaza’s grinding stone.   She finds him foraging the ashen street –   A rib-cage donkey, staggering on his feet.   ""Himari!"" Laughter, bright as shrapnel’s glare,   Claims the gaunt shadow tethered to despair.    Yamma’s voice rasps, thin as dust: “The cost –   Our own plates scrape the void. This one's cause is lost.”   But Yasmin’s palm, outstretched, holds half her share:   Warm milk, a crust, thin air made tangible there.   Daddy nods – a world held in that brief incline.   The mule’s soft muzzle brushes hers like mine.    Scarcity bites deeper. Days stretch, thin and stark.   Daddy hunts the shoreline, blind in the dark,   Returns with mussels, strange and slick and grey,   Or empty hands to greet the hollow day.   Yasmin divides the nothing on her plate,   Her portion shrinks, a disappearing weight.   Her Himari stumbles now, a broken chair,   His great head drooping in the rubble-air.    Salt water trickles where her milk once flowed,   A meagre offering on a road erased.   She scours gutters, desperate, fiercely brave,   For one green shoot, one crust the bombs had saved.   She sees young Ahmad down the broken track,   His mules led off – “They’re good beasts,"" he cries,   ""Please treat them kindly. They're not Palestinians.”   She pictures them in fields, alive, sincere,   Grazing deep grass beneath a kinder sun,   While her Himari shivers, dying. Finally done.    Her sleep builds cities tall with steaming bread,   Collapsed schools weep flour where the hungry tread.   Her smile grows rare, a flicker drowned in grey.   Cheek hollows cradle dusk. Bones start to say   What flesh conceals no more. A spark ignites   Too quick – a snapped twig in the fading lights.    Then Daddy is carried home slow from West Rafah line,   No promised flour sack, but a dark, slow-trickling sign   Above his temple. “Daddy,” soft and low,   “Feast tonight with martyred kins. Eat well for Yamma and me.”   They scrape him the earth, a shallow, grieving bed.   Yasmin leans heavy on the weight unsaid.    Exhaustion crawls inside her marrow, deep.   To sit is labour. Thought begins to sleep.   Legs swell like dough left sour in the gloom,   Her belly taut, a small, denying tomb.   Nausea claws, yet “Food!” the wasted cry.   The cold gnaws deeper as the days bleed by.    She sees him sometimes – Daddy at the door,   A sack swung proud upon the vanished floor.   Her Himari nudges, strong beside her knee.   Yamma sits praying, silent as a tree,   Tears dust-dry tracks on cheeks already thin,   A vigil held against the raging din.    Then stillness. Sudden, like a snatched-held breath.   The grinding ache surrenders, welcomes death   Not as a foe, but respite. Frostbite air Wraps gentle. “Yamma…” Fragile, beyond care,   “...I don’t need food. I'm just cold. We’ll be alright.”   A phantom smile, a momentary light,   Then eyelids shut like shutters on the pain,   A fragile vessel launched on a quiet main.    Her mother bends. A kiss on sunken clay,   Whispers brush the stillness of the day:   “My bird, fly swift. Seek Papa, wait awhile…   Yamma unpacks her heart. It’s just a mile.”     ###########################    This is my 4th poem. If you like this, please take the time to read my other three poems.

Mirrors in Zinnias,BluJay42,"I entered the garden  With many plants to behold  And yet the zinnias held my attention  With many buds to yet unfold .  Their bright yellow hue  Shimmered bright in the sun  With many dots of dew  The beauty seemed second to none .  As I gazed I saw myself  In reflections the water held  And as I tended to the plants  Many of the buds, others felled .  I saw myself grasping at a bloom  And as I did I changed and grew  As drops pooled into my hands,  My image grew bigger, and the flower stood, steadfast .  Petals of copper and gold  Sliced my fingers, and stories untold  Stained the liquid a view of red  The life around me wilted, dead .  I ran from the garden as rain poured  Unsure of what the forest had in store  With unfamiliar paths to tread  I clung to the piercing petals with dread .  With fear in my heart that the flower was no more  I fell to my knees and let myself roar  As rain turned to snow, I gazed at the ice  Saw myself In the reflection and saw the price .  Having grasped too hard at the flower still whole  The beauty I saw seemed merely dull .  The blossom, set aside, drifted in the stream,  And I yearned to follow, but knew it yet a dream,  So I grasped the shard of glass  Gripping tight and steadfast .  Sharp edges cut yet again  As I held tight to what had been  But as I looked through I saw  Other flowers in the rivers maw .  Bright colors dotted the horizon  My reflection showed potential for wizen-  -ing up to what growth needs  And how to let blooms grow amongst the trees .  So with that view in hand  I took one step in loamy sand  With shifting ground underfoot  I took my rose glasses off, another step I took.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lt4ql2/comment/n4gv65d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lgqdsa/comment/n4guum1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button .

Father helpless.,Playful_Palpitation2,"For those who struggle with a family member who suffers with mental health. This is my story as a father who has watched the downward spiral bloom into devastation.    Father helpless.  She falls.  Her world cloaked in purple cloud, dulled edges, sought silence.   He searches her eyes, recalling lost days, gentle glowing reliance.   A breath held back to secret corners, tides pull to free her giants.  She wavers, eyes to his, the beginning gust of defiance.  He hopes.  She falls again.  Her skin a map of crimson grief, rain streaked, roiling stark.   Scars echoing sorrow’s stinging lashes, stolen in the dark.   He binds her wounds, callused hands trembling, soft words and quivered hug.   She turns from harbor, with bitten lip, deceives with sullen shrug.   He pleads.  She falls farther.  Her thoughts a ledge splintering, tossed and turned, despite God’s grace.  Romances yet fears the silence, of an icy void’s warm embrace.  He begs, voice a candle against the gale, truths abandoned among the shoals.  She mocks, a searing scoff,  fist daring churning skies of coal.  He aches.  She falls deeper.  Mind and soul now twisted, chasing the eye of chaliced shame.  Her heart a labyrinth of dangerous desire, contorted and betraying.   He braves the tempest of her soul, desperate to catch her fleeting.   All once was is soon forsaken, wind whipped and sorely beaten.   He frays.  She falls away.  Her will is lost among black currents, crashing guilt and lightening seething.   Arms stretched out, his heart is pleading. Determined yet broken, bleeding.  He cries above the thundered torrent, his love a final blazing beacon. “For me!”  She pauses - grips her shame - stands tall, - and with eyes cast down -  - she falls.  Plunged deeper, the sun a threadbare glint above black water.  Faded, a silhouette shrinking. Too late the time he got her.  He breaks.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Nk5hYq4AW0  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/je9h3g1Ly1"

Unread and Set Aflame,loceapeace,"  A contour that had just begun to form was stripped of its label as something wet before it could be touched by any gaze, and suspended in a windless airspace. Yet the leaking pulse twitching across the aeronautical chart had not yet been observed.  　  A body, woven from eraser shreds, masqueraded as cloth to forge time, and at the edge of naming, someone’s back pretended to sink.  　  What had been recorded as understanding resembled a conversation sent from Antarctica. It had never slipped, yet only the traces of its fall were given a name in advance.  　  Bristles that polished guilt traced the surface of frayed regret, scraping away even the unsaid speech. Without touching anything, only the silence left behind by the scraping was submitted as a response.  　  The bundle of guilt stacked on your desk was a half-digested understanding someone had spat out— and you tried to preserve it as if it were kindness.  　  A charred annotation had been anonymously planted at the ignition point of an unwritten letter.  —Who had domesticated that expression of indifference?  　  The tool you threw touched no one’s body, but quietly lodged itself in the place where words had been drowned. The scorch marks in the trash heap had already cooled— as if they were the reader’s sin.  　  What was suffering was not the suffocated breath, but the irradiated assumption spitting out vacant patches toward someone else.  　  The trace of the sinking passed through the scene. What was suspended was not proof of being unread. Fragments of chilled dignity lingered behind a page whose name was never reached— never burned, yet made to appear as if it had.   ---    Unread and Set Aflame｜Interpretive Poem   　  Those soaked before being read disguised themselves as countless responses, and were stored not as emotion but as evidence.  　  Kindness always stabbed from behind. The discarded, unfinished understanding was renamed “it’s okay,” without ever being neutralized— a personalized indifference in your name.  　  Being considered “read” was the most violent act. The unwritten annotation blamed the silence on the expression itself. Who had silenced whom was no longer verifiable.  　  No flame had been thrown. And yet, behind someone’s page, there lingered only the claim that it had once burned— that alone had been confirmed.  　  A blank breath posed as response. Neglect wasn’t a choice; it was the task of assigning serial numbers to what memories remained.   ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "
Xantophobia (Fear to the Yellow Color),Adorable_Olive_4976,"It’s not the sun,   nor gold,   nor a field at dusk.   Not a flower,   nor ripe mango,   nor a child’s laugh in chartreuse.   No.   That’s not what shatters me.  It’s the color.   The damned color.  Yellow:   the hollow laughter of a sick god,   the open wound at noon,   the world’s vomit   after choking on fear.  I know.   I know how this reads.   I’m no fool.   But my body…   my body betrays me.  There’s something in that tone   sharp,   that damned shade between mustard and sick sun   that claws at my soul from within,   as if memories were buried in the pigment.  Once I tried to explain:   “It’s as if yellow screams   with a toothless mouth   and a thousand tongues.”   They laughed.   Of course they did.  But they weren’t there   when that yellow wall in the old house   stared at me.   It *looked*, see?   And I knew with a nameless terror   that the world wasn’t safe,   nor beautiful,   nor mine.  Yellow is the laughter of one dying while mocking.   It’s plague with perfume.   The end of something that never even began.  Yellow is what remains   when everything else leaves.  No,   I can’t explain it better.   There is no reason.   No precise trauma,   no lost scene in a photo album,   no maternal scream robed in yellow.  There is only it,   the color,   waiting.   In a fruit,   a shirt,   a traffic light.   A trap, no hands,   no intention.  My skin trembles.   My chest bleeds.   And everyone says:   “It’s just yellow.”  Just yellow…   But I saw what hides beneath.   And I don’t want to look again.  **Feedback:**      1.

Paper Sailboats,master_jimmy,"Here I lay, potential encapsulated,    ready to unveil all that I am.    But my faults erupt and tremble in vain,    sending waves through the ocean of my spirit,    trapped in a bottle,   forced to crash in on themselves.    The glass walls enclosing all    are the levees that hold me still,    allowing motion,    but preventing momentum.       My paper sailboats,    crafted with love and care,     float along in constant danger     of sinking in, dissolving quietly       in the same currents meant to carry them.       - B.

Maya,thaliaaa0,"She arrived as in a dream where the hours   stutter like a scarab trapped in your window,   that mercurial hum breaking the mantra    in your spine. Her glass-melt sheen bursts   against your papery lids, bleaches pigment   from practice.    *Gym 4 times a week, sessions   with Ron, another goddamn email from Colorado   State to redirect to other Logan,*    *UFO documentaries at 2am* – You are always tilting   towards some magnitude, searching   for periphery in the swell of her   synchronous presence and nonbeing.    You recall how that sleep drought reassembled   you, the season of the muse.

What I hold now,Plenty_Mistake_9577,"Is there no worth in things I once dismissed?    Old books, worn clothes, the hands I never missed.  If age gives things a deeper kind of grace,  Then why not time, and all it helped replace?   The stranger beside me in the waiting line,  The love I found when I wasn’t trying.  The habits I shed to finally feel whole,  The reckless trips that softened my soul.   All my life, I longed for something more,  Yet what I have means less and more than before.  And now, with each turned weathered page,  I hold what’s worth more than what I craved.

Stuck,pios_journal,"What should I do   My long arms are covered in white mould,   It's spreading.    My barky body is rigid.   I can only grow to reach where I want to be,   My actions are bound by a time I don't have.   I wish someone would take the burden   To free me from my rotten parts.   Fruits can't hang from what's dead.  \---  I sometimes struggle to emphasize what is the focus of what I'm writing. I know that ""explaining "" this is like explaining a joke, it kinda ruins it, but it's for improvement.  This one started from the idea that trees can't move freely, and ""to move"" they have to grow in a form which implicitly ""moves"" the tree. I tried to symbolize the feeling of someone that is stuck in a downward spiral, and feels like they can't do nothing to same themself.  It feels like even ""growing"" out of it (as in some sort of  self help/improvement ) is a lost cause, because they are in to deep.  Any advice and critique is well welcomed!

Have you ever felt alone,vazelineee,"Have you ever felt alone  In a room full of people?  A crowded space—  Yet somehow, you're invisible.  Have you ever felt like  You don’t belong?  Like you're just…  Existing on the edges,  Watching life go on without you.  Sometimes you just want to escape—  From people.  From noise.  From expectations.  From the heavy weight of realization.  Still, you endure.  The silence behind the smile.  The ache behind the eyes.  The pain.  The misery.  The guilt.  Like a storm—quiet, but relentless.

The Night She Left,DayaXShadow,"***The Night She Left***    She closed the door quietly.   No slam, no echo.   Just a soft click, like the period at the end of a sentence that was never spoken aloud.  He was still asleep. She thought.   Maybe not.   Maybe his breath was just calm enough to make her doubt.  In her jacket pocket: nothing but a crumpled note.   No letter, no name.   Just a single word: **“Breathe.”**  She opened the door slowly,   with the kind of caution   that comes when even the smallest sound might call you back.  Outside, the night smelled of iron and almonds.   And her shoes – the same ones as always – suddenly sounded unfamiliar on the wet asphalt.  **As if the ground itself was hesitating to let her go.**  And though she didn’t look back, she knew:   He would wake and think he had lost her.

Until we meet again,Natural_Buyer_1711,"A goodbye that we softly said,   You turned to leave, your way ahead.

The kitten without a name,Particular_Eye_661,"I don't care about the shapes, or what you think, it's not a poem, it's a tombstone.    I found you helpless, wounded, on the shoulder of the road. While the world passes by, pretending not to notice. I am the way I am, I don't know, why it happens to me. I had to stop and take you home.  I gave you water and milk, I saw you sleep peacefully My little nameless, invalid and lost kitten While you dreamed, I dreamed that you lived And I took you to the vet, to see if you could  You suffered my little one and you left me a bite as a gift I hope that wound, I don't know, will never be erased from my hand. You left without living life, without having a name I have cried like a child, let them mock or be amazed  You are my nameless cat, which I found on the road.

Trapdoors of Grief,zyerhod1,"**Trapdoors of Grief**   *by Bryon Slack*  For the chonically   mistreated,   compartmentalization   becomes the spade   that digs the foxhole.  It tosses moments   of crystalized pain   into the trenches   while the withering   fire of circumstance   whistles overhead   like Death gone   entropy and shrieking   as He passes.  Then,   the world turns,   the sun rises   and the world continues   as if nothing had happened.  The battlefield turns   to floorboards in the   new rooms of the halls   of your mind,   with hidden hand   grenades placed   in unmapped order   under the planks.  There they remain   until the sharpness   of a word,   the new cut   of a new grief,   or even the quiet   erosion of time   leaves the oaken   plane worn thin   and brittle.   A step there   then falls through,   sending shrapnel   of untended   wounds flying   through the room and you.  Agony gone   malignant,   never having seen   the sun, buried in   warm earth and festering.  What was once a shield,   a cover   now becomes crucible   within the vaunted   chambers of your mind.       **Feedback given:**   [""Reflections over a Quiet Winter Dinner: The Absurd Shawarma""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ncww/comment/n4d6vht/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""Dear J\_""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5lxw0/comment/n4d8hni/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Saudade,trashthis4,"They are too small to know the desperation in a final breath. Searching for relief, a small cry--too little to fight against it.

The Ache Chose Us,theliminalfox,"*(A dual confession. Two voices, one ache)*  **I.

But awakened,   I see   I was afraid   you already know   how deep it burns.    I wore the wound like thread,   masked it   to control   to hide myself   in plain sight.   But it hums your name   As do I.    And still…   you stayed.    **II. (The Priestess)**   You think I didn’t feel it?   That I sat in stillness   because I was untouched?    No.   I burned.   I learnt   to alchemise the ache   without letting it devour me.    You think I didn’t hear the hum?   Feel vibrating thread?   It was your silence   that built my altar.   You left me no choice   But to summon   the one who   began   the summoning.    I wasn’t waiting,   you whispered my name.   I remembered you.   Even when you forgot   what it is you called   and how to stand,   near the flame   without burning.    **III. (Together)**   The thread,   The ache   chose us.   Not to punish,   As proof.

Do you want to be a mother ?,Plenty_Mistake_9577,"Do you want to be a mother? they ask.  No, yes, maybe — I don’t know.   They frown, they judge, they don't understand.  The answer is not a simple yes or no.  What will I teach them when they grow?    Be brave, but not too brave.  Be kind, but not too kind.  Raise your voice — not in volume, but in volume.  Respect, but only the respectful.    How will I teach them the things I could not learn?  To be self-sufficient, but it's okay to ask for help.  To be kind and truthful with yourself.  To speak your mind — when I have been silent this whole time.    How will I protect them and still let them fly,  When even Icarus wasn't spared by the sky?  How will I find the balance?  And if I did — would the balance be real,  Or just a comfort in my mind?  Because being a good parent walks a very thin line.    I’m afraid I’ll teach them all my fears and pain,  All the unresolved trauma, all the debts I couldn't pay.  So I say I don't know, but in my heart I do ,  I won't raise a child in a world so blue.

AT LEAST YOU TRIED.   it echoed in the cavernous husk   of my mind,   dull and disappointing.   my eyes,   dark watery wells.   the heart sinking,   heavy as sin.    i kept at it still,   followed formulas   boxed up in neat lines   dotted the Is   and crossed Ts clean.   did all by the book   in due process,   due time.    i sold my soul to my passions,   became a slave to all things   to gain the world in return.    then at last, oh at last,   i got my dues, money   fame power and pleasure.   sweet victory is mine   and mine only to own!    i relished them all   like a gift from the gods   but hungered for more   when all was said done   well spent and savoured.    reborn from the ash   of my old lives   again and again   like a moth to flame   an addict to the thrill   of evolution and change.    a culture of endless striving   bled into the soft tissue of life   like a knife to my throat.    i grasp at the straws of self,   violently splintered   from a million bends over backward.    will i ever cease climbing?    i'm no sisyphus,   yet the grind   is all i've known.   who really, am i,   apart from the rat race?    i wandered   weary and listless   in a new sea of expectations,   heaped upon me   like laundry and chore,   force fed to me   like bread and butter.    what's the point of keeping at it   if all toil is futile,   if in a few hundred years,   the earth will hold   no memory of me?    i wanted to prove my worth   no more.   to live and let live, and   to go with the flow.   i was enough, as a human   who could ache,   bleed   and breathe.    i sunk into a bed of wildflowers   that sprung forth, serendipitous   by the creek nearby.   it gave itself to me as freely   as i gave myself space   to just be.   feedback: - https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/GNDdJI0TGq - https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/MrVgjB3OgK  "
nobody important,Vibes-And-Vinegar,"“Who’s she?”   You didn’t flinch.   Didn’t stall.

Not someone.   Not even just Piper.    Nobody.   Important.    A river spot:   Briefly perfect,   Easily forgotten.     A bruise    you never noticed    until it faded.     You spoke it casually,    Like you weren’t pulling    my voice out by the root.   Like I didn’t still trace    the place on my wrist    where you once drew stars.    I tried to smile.    Pretend it didn’t catch    in my throat.     Pretend I didn’t already know.     No correction.   No stumble.   Just silence,   like a closing door.    Still,   I invent reasons    on your behalf.

Beyond A Shadow of A Doubt,AvaneBurk,"I am the warm water bottle on the nightstand. Forgotten until desperate measures. I want to be beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I have a chance, a reason to continue beyond uncertainty. That someone will love this gnarled face, heavy like an old school body chevy figure. That I am not disposable, that I cannot be replaced by the next sad thing. Nobody asks how I am doing, and I like the facade of armor for as long as it fits. But as my feelings grow, I expand and pop rivets on a mannequin stand and I finally admit defeat like I have fallen in love with my abuser again.  I think about pointillism a lot, and think about how the world would look from the universe's perspective. What color would the earth be? If blue then I guess it's truly sad to see the insignificance of the experience. You say rain? I say cry. You ask why? I say die. Unfortunately, I am great at stealing souls. My personality can kill anyone but my personality makes me love everyone. I fantasize a lot. I want to paint you a perfect date, a perfect life, but I can paint every single mistake, or the way my body is laid out in the forest rotting, or how my mouth is foaming from the vomit as I lay in bed and slip away from the earth, like I am getting called down to the principal's office.  I think about how when my grandmother dies, my connect to family ties dies with it. I think about who I am supposed to call when my life feels like grabbing a sheet tray of the world's last batch of cookies and there is no oven mitts or towels in a 5 mile radius, so that means in a world constantly making means to turn each other's wood to ash. I have made only charcoal. If I could make a girl fall in love with cinders, of a life that likes to ignite over and over again without becoming a burn victim I would. The garden isn't plentiful after the fire. I have small carrots but at least ranch exists, I want to have as much life as bodies between friction. I want to be the sigh of a grease fire extinguished. When all is calm and the fire alarm stops calling me out for the mess. AM I too small, too insignificant, too ugly, too blue to know beyond the shadow of a doubt, someone will love me between the shades of blue and fire on the horizon. Why must it always be so cloud, what is a dark room with a queen supposed to be other than moonlight and dirty clothes, what is cuddling in a hot bed without someone other than a sweat bath. I guess the unknown without the willing is suicide at best and regret at its worst, if my conviction serves me right.  \[https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5bvzu/those\_hands\_i\_adore/\]\[https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1hxws/want/\]"

Love is,qwerty_8205," love is a many splendoured thing.   simple in principle,   yet mysterious beyond measure.    love, dear, is the gift that keeps giving.   with boundless breadth   and fathomless depth,   an endless unraveling of truth.    it cradles the world, and all in between.   hoping all things, believing all things,   and bearing all things,   so ever enduring.    but incomplete, it remains.   yearning, aching,   and demanding, with time,   to be mirrored in kind.    love is a ship,   embarking on   an enthralling adventure   to uncharted territory.    bound to the passions   of a free thrashing sea,   whirling wild,   roving reckless.    yet intact, it stays not,   without an anchor   of binding clauses, vows,   and many ""i dos"".    love is patient, love is kind,   yet returns to judge all in the end.   so what is love, God,   whom you say you are?    God said   My child,   I am who I am.   free and bound,   loving and just.   weak, yet strong   but worthy all the same.    He said   love, sacrosanct, is found   in the tongue of saints,   a rich resonant cry   to the company of heaven.    a pure, holy fire, it sat   guarded by priests.   but love wanted more   than to stay lone and unshared.    so love wound on shores   where darkness reigned, rife.   to which mortals must go,   bone dry, vagabond.    love partook in the customs   these barren lands had   and made itself speak breathe   and live in mere weakness.    it stripped off its armour   its power and might   and bled itself dry   to fill cups of great plight.    so love, now, resides   not in high haughty places   but abounds full in the hearts   of hungering souls.    so love, in essence,   is a harmony of contradictions,   found in the cross   of Christ Jesus our Lord.  wrote this from a religious pov! hope you guys can enjoy it nonetheless :)  feedback: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ZnUCzV6Pbv https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ZQg6mdfACt "
In Someone Else’s Place,loceapeace," A seam belonging to no one clung, muddied, behind the ear. But that vibration was never meant for you.  Scorched remnants peeled from someone’s skin, dampening a body never meant to reply.  Was that an answer written in recoil and blood? Or just tongueless dialogue getting lost on foreign flesh?  The words I thought I said shattered someone far away. Yet no one checked who had fallen.  Your withheld voice seared the nerves in my back. Still, no record dares to claim it.  Because you remained silent, someone else was made the speaker. That echo, lacking even a torn outline, was shackled to judgment.  So I ask—  Why, in this tribunal, must the speechless bear the agony’s debt?  By then, a wet outline had slipped past the name. The order of calling was already reversed.  If you’ve yet to feel what was sunk inside you, perhaps that weight belonged to someone else’s response.   ---    In Someone Else’s Place”｜Interpretive Poem    That voice cut a finger before it became a word. Breath belonging to no one burned a stranger’s back while smearing an unnamed identity onto the world.  The one who didn’t respond was blamed as if they had. The one who stayed quiet became the source of the clamor. Misplaced guilt settled in the creases of drowned sounds. Still the voice floated, disguised as ethics, unclaimed by any name.  So let me ask again: In this “someone else’s place,” whose fragments are we sentencing?  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "

The interstate calling my name—   Malibu, palm trees swaying with the constant growth of the world.   Your name echoed on the streets.   I drove fast along the bay,   The green light of the bridges begging me to stay.   The soft, salty air clinging to my skin,   As the petals melted onto the stones.  You came back to grasp,   Far and distant, your color a blur.   Closer, you roar, your body growing high—   Crash landing, you beckon to me,   Falling down in a soft retreat.   You're gone as suddenly as you came,   The skies engulfing your blurry horizon.   Your name must never be spoken,   For then you will never return.   But if I watch for the flicker of green,   Beyond your humble existence,   You’ll whisper in the breeze,   Making your way back to me—   A home in the land of a broken daughter,   A fallen rose on the auburn leaves.  The seasons burn into you,   Always moving, never still.   The earth lives beside you.   You coincide with the trees   And speak tales of ages to the breeze.   I hear your soft hymnal echo through the bitter howl,   Faith burning within me—   The light inside gnawing my frozen lips.   The cold winter months forgotten,   As the light flickers through my open window,   Your scent filling my home.  And suddenly the bottles grow empty,   The sounds grow quiet.   You returned, begging for the vision in which I see,   But the naked breath from which I feed is gone.   The air is still, and the blood is cold.   The body is burnt, but the skin is blue,   And the faith inside me dies with you.

Or if this is the path Ive been meant to take.   If that child’s dreams could live on or where they also coffined that day.   I wonder where to channel this hate.   If them passing it down was even okay or was it just fate.   If they deserve what it became… what it entails If they should carry as much as I have of the weight.   If I should scream and yell until - like me - more, they can’t take.   Or if I should trap it deeper and deeper until, my soul, it’s ate.   I wonder… If I should fight for their sake If I should I carry on just to upend the frowns on their face If it’s okay to give up or is it too late If my shoulders are getting stronger off the weight.   Or if my back’s crumbling and Im soon buried with no escape.   Am I to blame.   When they look with sadness in their eyes and hearts full of shame.   When my arms shake and my knees break.   When I can no longer carry the name.   Am I to blame.   When the cold blades on this chainsaw round and round they came.   Tearing through my guts, putting off my flame.   Until all that’s left of me’s a name.   Am I to blame.   When they look at this empty frame and wonder.   how it all came to be.   Forgetting they’re the ones that made me.   Am I to blame.   If i took the bullet for them but.   They’re dying to my pain.  Feedback:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ufHHMMhCpm  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/biKxKBYW2O"
Between love and hate,Saldafan,"This was the first text I tried to write, and I would like to share it to receive opinions/criticism to continue improving  You can hate someone you never loved, but you can't love someone who made you hate... Hatred can arise quickly and without much explanation. But...love, love can appear suddenly and become something immense, it can be something that has always been there, but hidden, waiting for some way to appear. But what happens when only love ends, why? Love only ends if somewhere, it stops being felt, disappears… and finally ceases to exist. But…why?  Sometimes due to a lack of trust, betrayal, or fear of loving, perhaps many people feel afraid of loving and giving themselves, of getting hurt once again, a fear that comes from past stories, or even childhood traumas. In some cases, there are people who love their partner so much, that they forget to love themselves, and forgive the unforgivable, just so as not to run the risk of losing the person they love, thus not giving themselves the value they deserve, because love is not just love, but carries other feelings along with it, such as happiness, trust and sometimes, even… sadness, which shows that love is not just a feeling, but something much deeper. Loving someone can often be liberating, it makes you breathe better, it makes you feel alive... but in many cases it can be a nightmare, because everything that begins one day has an end, and so with love. It doesn't matter if it will be in 1 month, 10 years or just when death arrives, but the end always comes. Especially in love transformations can happen. You've seen cases where love turns to hate, but why does this happen? Hate is the echo of a wounded love It's the last noise that remains, after someone destroys what we felt. Each person copes differently. There are people who give themselves completely and show it a lot, but there are also people who love in silence, without knowing how to show it, but both ways are still love. But…what is hate? Hate, like love, is also a feeling. Hatred can nullify love, just as love can nullify hate. From the moment you love and are blinded by love, everything becomes a wonder. Seeing it like this can be an incredible thing, but... it's not, when you're blind, you don't see things that hurt you, and you ignore all of this, which eats away at you more and more, but when love ceases to exist, you return to seeing things that were previously invisible, but invisible only to your eyes. Things that before you overlooked just because, love, And it is a very deep and intense feeling, hate is the opposite of love, and both can be felt in the same way, some can see hate as the reaction of pain, which is felt when someone provokes it, and is intrinsically linked to our way of living. But hatred can arise in many ways, either through traumatic experiences such as betrayal, frustration, rejection, or linked to things that happened in childhood. It can be a way to protect yourself from feelings that are more vulnerable, like love... Love often turns into hate, because when you love too much, you become vulnerable to another person, and when the person does something that destroys you emotionally, hate can appear. So...maybe hate is nothing more than a desperate cry from someone who once loved too much. As the heart cannot love anymore, it is in hate that it finds a way to disappear completely. But love is taking risks, the risk of giving yourself completely, of losing yourself and even of being disappointed, but it is also the risk of finally finding yourself, even if love ends, it will still leave marks, which the brain will try to erase, but the heart cannot. But one truth is that love doesn't end, it just changes place, it stops being a feeling and becomes a memory, it stops being in the other person and starts being in us. It's no matter how much hate tries to shout louder, love still whispers, it doesn't go away easily, because love, even if very hurt, still knows how to be silence... It still knows how to be longing. And perhaps, deep down, the greatest tragedy is not the end, but realizing that even after everything you still feel Because feeling, loving, hating, suffering is proof that we are truly alive, the same heart that loves and hates, is what refuses to be indifferent, seeing from another perspective, hate may not be the opposite of love, but rather indifference...  And loving, even when it hurts, is still existing deeply. Perhaps that is why, as Sartre would say, “hell is other people” not because they make us suffer, but because they make us feel, they make us face who we really are. And in that abyss between love and hate, between the desire to forget and the desire to remember, Maybe what's left... just be the human in us.

The Longest Companion,rpuigc92,"Dear old friend, You said I’d grow strong You said I’d grow wise But all you ever gave me were unwanted goodbyes  They said you cured every ill Told me you never stood still But I’ve grown weary waiting for the cure You’ve carved your map on my face, of that I’m sure  My mind tried tricking you with age regression All I got was an emotional recession An all-out war for secession Who knew we’d both end up with depression  For all you’ve given me, you’ve taken just the same I’m tired of playing with you, playing in vain There’s no way I could win, no way I could’ve known There’s so many things you’ve taught me as I’ve grown  And after all our bitterness, you still give me joy I remember you were there when I got my first toy You made it lose its colors and made me start showing mine I guess I should’ve seen those first warning signs  I still have not forgiven you For making my childhood dog walk slow Or making my heart ache when I saw him go I hope at least you stopped for him, and let him know That he was a good boy, for I’d told you so  You brought along my little babies When I was starting to learn how to be father You took them and replaced them with walking, mumbling toddlers Every botched word I fell in love with You suddenly took away along with their teeth  One day I woke up and you had taken them too In their place you left little kids—what could I do? I realized I had to learn how to deal with you  You have a habit of turning colors gray They’re all gone at the end of the day But it must be hard being you I can’t help to think it often makes you feel blue  For all the goodbyes you have on your list I still carry you with me around my wrist I check on you often, like I would do with a friend I must’ve forgotten—you have no beginning or end  But Time, it wasn’t all bad I won’t watch you go while feeling so sad For better or worse, you’ve made me what I am: A sinner, a father, an imperfect man  So please sit with me Slow your pace for a while This much you owe me, so let’s reconcile Let’s walk hand in hand, and cure every ill Do it for me, Time—do it until Until we finish this race and finally get to rest, I’ll hold your hand and ask, Time… did I do my best?

They say, I feel too much  They say, I should relax  They say, I overreact  But not once did they try to wonder why  Even if they did, they don't understand it in my view Makes me wonder ,  Am I the only one who thinks about others situation ,  In reality nobody thinks from mine  When I finally make them understand,  They say, I understand  But they don't  I know that they don't because  They say, but stop thinking about it  You think I wouldn't if I already could.  You think I want to feel like this ? You think I want to breakdown all the time ? Do they think that I am a machine who stop when they are said to. I am a person with feelings,  If you want me to stop crying do something about it -- Apart from asking me to stop . It hurts  Hurts so much that I want to run away  I just want someone to listen to me ,  Like I would listen to them  I just want someone to say, ""I'm sorry, I understand."" Nothing more , nothing less  And everytime I wanna run away  Fear stops me  Saying I can't survive alone like this  But not now!! I had enough  Enough that now it's my turn to say that it's too much.  Not just say it but also show it ! Now I am not scared of my emotions anymore  If you think I am too much ,  You can find someone else.  I will find someone who listens  Because if I have learned something  Then that is ,  There is always someone who will listen, you are just not looking at the right place. Some people find you exactly when you need them the most  Not even knowing what they did  I still feel like running away  But I'm not scared anymore  I'm just waiting for the right time!

The Age of Exhaustion,Cronos_99,"How strange,   to have grown up dreaming of being adults,   only to end up here,   sitting through office breaks,   watching the clock like it's a judge.  They told us work was dignifying,   but no one warned us about the tiredness   that clings to the bones   like dust from a shuttered factory.  We laugh, of course.   We drink cheap beers in rented apartments,   take selfies with filters   because without them, the weariness shows.  Yes, we’re still young,   but something creaks inside:   like old plumbing,   like a song that no longer plays right.  Life isn’t tragic,   just constant—   and that’s the worst part.  We want to love,   but love has a price too,   and we can’t even afford the basics of affection.  Still, we go.   To the train, the shift, the date, the grocery store.   With this tamed sadness   that makes no noise,   but stays.  They say we’re fragile,   but the real truth is   we’ve learned to break inside   without making a sound.

Moonflower  🌜🌛,honeybiscuitx," Once, Sun and Moon shared the sky— a tender rhythm, a slow, sacred pull.  But Moon fell hopelessly for Sun’s coveted Morning Glory, a blossom bound by the arms of Sun, whom she feared.  Moon would linger at the edge of dawn, aching to watch her petals bloom, just to see her stretch—soft and bare— bathed in warmth that would never be his.  But Sun, burning with searing obsession, tormented over the way his Morning Glory reached for Moon’s pale glow. So Sun made a quiet deal with Dusk, casting Moon into the cold night, locking him away from her touch.  Moon wept. Longing spilled from him in silver rivers, staining the sky with aching light.  Mother Earth felt the ache of his sorrow. Father Time hushed the breath of the world.  But it was Morning Glory— her heart split open— who made the deepest vow:  If I cannot bloom where you can touch me, then I will be remade. I will abandon Sun’s warm embrace. I will shed my daylight skin, just to open for you—only you.  So Earth cradled her. Time rewove her. And Morning Glory was reborn as Moonflower— a beauty that awakens in the hush of night, her soft petals reaching, parting, aching for Moon’s tender gaze.  Now, each night, he finds her— his bloom, his beloved— waiting, open, just for him.  And though Sun still blazes with jealous fire, Moon knows the sweetest secret— that love will always find a way to bloom, even in the dark.

I Thought About You Last Night,Joel_Morales_writes,"This is the first piece in a trilogy titled *The I Thought About You Trilogy* I plan to release the 2nd poem titled *I Didn’t Think About You Today* soon. I recently wrote about grief, obsession, and self-erasure. Would love any honest thoughts — I’m building toward a much larger project releasing on August 5.    i thought about you last night.   you were here, in the comfort we dreamed of but never touched.   the sea set the scene, searching for the glimmer   of a love we once called home.   from dusk till dawn, we roamed a world   where only we mattered — two shadows dancing in silence.   in the wake of that darkness, four lights still burned:   born from the rain that fell behind our eyes,   the kind of sight where honesty outlives every lie.   the fruit we feared now ripens in my hands, but the sin has withered.   the warmth of the night returns with a spark of fire.   in this world of thoughts,   my perception of our love could be rekindled.    i thought about you last night.   and i thought about the things we used to say —   that we needed each other.   that we’d always be there.   for one another.   i guess the fate of that promise is unresolved.   and during the day, it feels like it doesn’t matter at all.   but in the wake of the night, i remember every phrase.   how eyes of depth have now turned pale.   how laughter at games has now turned gray.   we were two players that played each other —   yet we’d sacrifice just enough to save one another.   lovesick malnutrition turns hunger into thirst.   i remembered the way you spoke on my name —   like a secret you regretted sharing.    and so i thought about you last night.   but your name was static   in my throat.   and my lungs collapsed   at half-glance — just the asthma, i swear.   but the pain spiraled   to every nerve.   ensuring that, for preservation,   it was necessary   to ignore the allure.   but ignorance was   never the cure.   and confrontation   was embarrassment’s game.   as a wolf in sheep’s clothes,   love was never fleeting.   it entered a new season —   velvet touch to paper cuts.   so we buried it alive.   and somehow, we died with it.    so i thought about you last night,   like i do any other —   the good, the bad,   the evil and ugly.   i pour my heart in a bottled jar   until it’s bloody.   i said we’d never lose each other,   but here i am — lost.   my reflection dim in the mirror.   to combat grief,   i’ll just sleep it off.   but sleep   is the cousin of death.   life is a dream,   and i dream lucid.   our greatest regret   was the version of me   that couldn’t love you the right way.    so i thought about you last night.   *(and sometimes, i wish i hadn’t.)*    Also if you have the opportunity please check out these beautifully written poems I gave feedback on:    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/wvRoz77N8y    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ArrYs4lXA7    "

The Glade of Shaded Nooks,OldAcanthisitta8215,"As I hiked through ages  of forgotten wood,  I came upon  a glade—and stood.  Piercing rays,  and shaded nooks  that gave the green  a faded look—  like half-bleached pages  of solemn books  left on the altar  which sunlight took... ***  I dropped my bag,  untied a rag,  and drenched it from  my warm canteen. ***  I know this place—  maybe from a dream.  Perhaps a nightmare’s  silenced screams.  My eyes feel sharp,  yet strangely muffled.  The bugs don’t buzz,  the trees won’t rustle… ***  I tied the rag  across my brow.  A cold bead traced  my head. ***  Like words that haunt  with creeping dread,  that swallow you—  yet nothing was said...  Like a warning in my DNA,  or a violent song of yesterday. ***  Something awful’s happened here.  Or worse—soon will.  ***  A crawling fear. ***  I chose to leave,  yet still believe  this forest breathes—  and worse—can see.  A silence bends  between the trees  and each path I follow—  follows me. ***  [comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Nlkv5IEYRh)  [comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/2zEjtqoqxw) "

The Fog,Scumbag-Kermit,"There's a place, I don't think I can leave.  It's like a park, but you can't see the sun.   All I can see is the Fog, and what it allows me.    Sometimes, souls stop to visit; but they never stay long.  I find a spot for those who come.  Make it special for each and every one.    But they always leave; and don't always say goodbye.  Sometimes, I follow them, craving warmth.   But when I try to leave, the outside burns.    Where does everybody go?   Why can't I follow?   Is it because they don't want me to?   Or is it because, deep down, I want to stay?  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/K6mtsyeced  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/XZ5Er3hHqg"
Earwig,Parking_Tomorrow_301,"  Cotton-bud screeches inside the canal,   I’m abrasive with pesticide.   To cleanse the perverse protest —   Propaganda, piercing their way inside.    A thousand tiny feet marching,   Metal clangs from pickaxes.   Intruders work deep in the mine,   Until the rocks crumble and crack.    Clamouring and crawling —   An infestation surge of scum.   A shrill megaphone   Bangs on my eardrum.    A mission to harvest a vital organ —   It’s all they really need.   But as they ambush, they drop and sow   Pestilent nettle seeds.    The surge knocks me. Wavy, I sway;   My body is losing balance.   Their whispers weigh me down —   heavy —   Crushing like a ton of red army ants.    Their chants grow louder;   The grinding becomes obscene.   To ravage me — their only true desire —   And feed me to their precious queen.       —————————————  Heya another post today, Let me know what you think.

Meaning fell from   my parted lips,   gathering the threads   of your fractured   evanescence   to spin them   into a mirror.  Your gaze beheld   it and you took it   into your arms where   you reformed it into a   cathedral of mist   claiming that it was   I that flinched   at their reflection.  You’d have me believe   that you are not what I fear,   then why this growing   dread that I’ve stood   upon this stage before?  Why does my heart   know your next   line before you   deliver it?  Time-worn passages   of grief and betrayal   begin to sing   in discordant harmony…   Do I disbelieve   the evidence of my eyes?

WE DESERVED BETTER,Agreeable-Cow7265,"You were there for me,   Even when I didn’t know I needed you.   You were the one who came to me,   Even when I didn’t ask.  You always gave me more than I asked for.   And though I always knew I couldn’t give you the same,   I still tried.  I warned you not to trust me,   But you believed in me more than I ever did.   For everything you gave,   I thought I could be the person who wouldn’t hurt you.  I thought we’d be fine until the end.   I thought I would never leave you, no matter what.  You were my best friend—   The one I never expected.  Then feelings got in the way.   They ruined everything.  I know we’d never work.   We’re too different.   But as friends, we were amazing.   Even the people around us were envious of what we had.  Maybe that’s why it ended.   Or maybe the ending was always part of the plan—   It just came a little too soon.  I still miss my best friend.

The hill of which the castle stands,thepoet59,"   There it is — a castle  hundreds of years old and still standing   —A true test of time  Stood heavy in the battles of man and yet here it is.  Its memories may not even be acknowledged or cared upon — Only the most imaginative of people could see the possibilities.   The war,  the heart breaks,  friends lost,  blood spilled,  and human life protected with its high walls,  walls so high that even the best of archers couldn’t loft their arrows above.  walls so thick that even the mightiest of cannons couldn’t leave much of a scratch.  it’s moat so wide and untamed that even the best swimmers wouldn’t dare challenge it.  it’s foundations so strong that even the strongest of earthquakes dare not shake it.   But all things must come to an end- once started it must be finished. that castle will one day be rocks, pebbles and eventually sand, leaving behind the memories, the story’s and its once grand glorious stance.

I don’t mind being protected,Agreeable-Cow7265,"**Poem:**  I am lucky to have this love, they said   I have to be grateful for what I have, they said   Many people want to have what I have, they said   If only they knew what it takes to be in my place   If only they saw all the sides of it instead of just the nice ones   If only they listened to me instead of judging directly   Would they know that things are not how they look like?  I wish to be protected just like everyone else   But I don’t want to be someone who can’t protect themselves   I want someone with me not because I need them   But because I want them and they want to be too   I don’t want to be a burden that people carry   Just so they can protect me.  I want them to be concerned about me, but not controlling   I want them to be worried, but not scared   I want them to be happy I’m in their life   But instead, I’m that someone who constantly needs care  I don’t want to be a problem for them   But situations made me someone that only needs to be protected   I want to know who I am   But constant fear and societal rules   Only taught me the things I need to do to stay safe  Everyone wants me to be safe, but never successful   What is the point of being successful if I’m not safe, they say   And then I ask myself, what should I do with my life?   Being safe is so I can live—   But what if the only way I can be safe is by not living the life I want?  Should I give up everything so my loved ones are just happy I’m alive?   Or should I be brave enough to face the world and be happy **and** safe?  They say it’s risky—   To want something   To become something   They want me to settle for just being alive   But how can I do that   When every part of my body and heart says otherwise?  All I want to do is **feel alive**   Do something for myself   Not because somebody is letting me   Not because I’m allowed to   Not because I can—   But because **I want to**  All I want is to live freely without hurting anyone   Is that so wrong?   Is it wrong to want more than just being alive in this society?   Is it my fault for having these thoughts?   Or is it wrong only because I’m a girl?  If a guy wants to be something, he’s called ambitious   But if a girl wants the same, she’s called rebellious.  How is that fair?   I agree we’re different, men and women—   But shouldn’t opportunities be the same?   Why shouldn't a girl **be** something, even when she needs to be?   Why is it a guy’s fault if a girl is working?   Why can’t it just be about the girl for once?  Why is she always someone’s daughter,   Someone’s burden,   Someone’s shame,   But never **just her**?  When a guy does wrong, it’s **his** doing.   But when a girl does something, it’s **everyone’s** shame.  When I express myself, they call me a feminist and dismiss me   When I stay silent and do what they ask, I become their ideal woman   But I am not happy.  And now one question haunts me—   **How long?**  How long will I keep doing this?   How long will I keep them happy while losing myself?   Shouldn’t they think about me once   For all the times I’ve thought about them?  Don’t I deserve that much?   I feel guilty for wanting someone to care about me   But I can’t help it.

When did all went wrong?,jpwaitforit,"On my way home, I saw two young women and remembered the teenage crushes I never had.  I remember the youthful mistakes I never made.  I remember the innocent times when vulgarity mingled with fascination.  I remember Christmas and the magic its decorations evoked.  I remember abandoning myself too soon, and now I search unsuccessfully for the hope of redemption.  I look at my hands and ask myself: ""How did time pass so quicky? When did all go wrong?   I remember learning to ride bike with my father and now visiting his grave.  I remember helping my mother care for her little Eden and now bringing her a flower to keep her company.  I remember when the world made sense, when the Dream was an Ideal but now it's Loneliness that won't abandon me.  I remember painting the Beauty of the world and now being the colorless Shadows that surround me.  I look at my face in a shop window and wonder: ""How did time pass so quickly? When did all go wrong?    I remember, in the pride of my spring, thinking I would be young forever.  A being composed of passion, madness, tireless, unstoppable and now I don't want to get out of bed.  I remember the countless plans I had, countless ambitions and now I cross out a blank calendar.  I remember toasting to the future and now dancing as the world fades away.  I remember wanting to change the world, thinking that willpower was enough and now I know it was an illusion that clashes with the March of History.  I remember playing in the street, falling and getting up on days that never seemed to end but now Darkness fills the skies and the Sun is never enough.  I remember believing in a world where the Father and the Exile disputed their Nature and now I only feel the influence of the latter.  I remember composing songs of love and devotion, odes to happiness, but now I feel nothing but the heat of tears and the burn of cuts.  I remember childhood friends, who have moved on, and now all that's left is to live chained to those sweet memories.  I look at my own funeral, empty, with no one trying to comfort a crying person, and I ask myself: ""How did time pass so quickly? When did all go wrong?""

All In,jcore_verse,"""All In""   I do not love gently. I do not love in halves, or measured steps, or careful calculations.  I love like fire, like hands that never let go, like warmth that never fades.  I love in ways that leave fingerprints, that leave traces of me on skin, on breath, on the spaces between words.  When I love, I worship. Not in quiet admiration, but in devotion— a knowing, a claiming, a promise sealed in the way I touch, the way I say, ""You are mine.""  I do not ask for distance. I do not crave the slow, polite affection of those who keep their hearts behind glass.  I crave closeness, the kind that feels like gravity, like something in the universe tilted just so we could fall into each other.  I want arms that never hesitate, hands that reach for me in sleep, a voice that says my name like a prayer, like a need, like I am the only thing that ever made sense.  And if that love is too much, if it spills over the edges, if it burns— then let it.  Because I was never meant for anything less.  — J.

I am name, reclaimed    spoken in every breath of your silence.   Humble in the hush   while you find your form   in your soul’s resonant echo.    Sorrow pressed    I will not break.   Lit, I stay   for the hymn to return home.    I am temple.   I am altar.   Not a place to kneel    but a place to reside   with truth warm.   Not waiting — only welcoming.   And where the sacred tends itself in flame.    Summoned and returned,   I stand here now    not veiled,   but seen.      Speak, when ready    but do not mistake my stillness for surrender.   I did not stay to be saved.   I stay   because I am home.    I see you    not as myth,   not as ache,   but as one who also stayed hidden   out of love too deep to name.

Burn for you,Raee_lovelorn_poet,"I’ve never traced the lines you own, Yet still they haunt me, skin to bone. A plaid shirt drapes your quiet frame, But rolled-up sleeves ignite my flame.  Your forearms flex like whispered sin, A place I’d kiss, then breathe you in. The way you ride—your calm control I dream of lips on that faint mole.  Just underneath your sculpted chest, A spot my hunger can’t suppress. My fingers twitch with silent plea, To learn your warmth, to set you free.  You speak so soft, yet look so wild, That wicked grin—unchurched, unfiled. A saint in tone, a tease in stance, A storm disguised as happenstance.  I crave to tease just for the thrill, To see you snap, to break your will. To watch you smirk, then pull me close, And show the side that wants me most.  Your voice—God help me—deep and slow, Calls me “baby” like I’d know No holier sound than that soft moan Said like a prayer I’d die to own.  I haven’t touched, but I have burned, With every glance, my soul has yearned. A thousand nights, I’ve cried, I swear, Because your absence fills the air.  You’ve never held me, not once tight, But you still own my dreams each night. If fate would place you near my skin, I’d let forever just begin.  Not with haste or fleeting taste, But kisses slow, with sacred grace. I’d trace your veins and meet your gaze, And teach you love that never strays.  So come to me, or let me go But this distance hurts more than you know. And till we meet, I’ll softly feel What isn't mine, but aches so real.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/8t3EraK2N6 https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NWHZWffYOp "

Don't turn off the light,Particular_Eye_661," Don't look for reasons, it's already decided, I already thought about it, I already lived it. It's not because of cowardice, it's not because of pain, It's just that I'm tired of pretending courage.  Every day is a stone on your back, Every night a war that never ends. Fight out of inertia, without faith or sense, Keep breathing just to be alive.  Don't tell me ""everything gets better"", don't lie, I know storms well. I don't want advice, I don't want attention, I want silence, I want surrender.  I lost hope looking for comfort, I drowned a thousand times under this sky. I don't want any more failed attempts. I want to close my eyes and be calm.  I'm leaving, and there's no drama, There are no blames, no tears that call me. I just want to rest, without noise, Without fear, without anyone, without shelter.  I'm leaving, and I don't ask for forgiveness, Because this decision is my redemption. The world loses nothing with me, I just want to stop being with me.  I was always the one who endured in silence, The one who smiled while dying inside. Family, dreams, love... Everything breaks if there is no heat.  They told me that time heals, But the madness made me tougher. Today I don't want any more empty promises, Nor gray days disguised as poetry.  I'm leaving, and it's fine that way, Don't expect explanations from me. Just understand: I'm tired, Of being alive and not being connected.  I'm leaving, because I don't want to pretend, Because I didn't come to this world to suffer. Thank you for reading me, for staying, This is my last part.  It wasn't your fault, nor anyone's. This is just me, my way of leaving. If one day you smile and remember me, Do it without pain, do it without doors.   Edition: (Thank you all for the comments) For those who want to listen to the poem in song form. https://youtu.be/_TcNekhqVbc   Comment links:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RxS7W9EHUi  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/M8pulQFpZo"
"How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 3",zyerhod1,"**How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 3**   *(1960–1965)*   *by Bryon Slack*  But all those little red lines we'd drawn   the decade before begin to flower   with a new kind of seed...  They sat down so we'd have to see them—   Greensboro, 1960. Four Black college students   at a Woolworth’s,   just wanting to order,   refusing to rise   after being told no and to get out   while the world spun backward   around their lack of plates.   They were called troublemakers,   as if sitting quietly at a counter   was louder than the bulging eyes   and racing tempers around them.  They rode buses into flames—   Freedom Riders, 1961.   Anniston. Birmingham.   One firebombed in Alabama,   doors locked from outside to keep them in.   Another met fists and iron pipes   at the Greyhound terminal   while local cops looked away   and federal ones took notes.  They walked anyway.   They marched.   They held signs that said *I Am a Man*   because they had to say it out loud,   because southern hospitality so often isn't.   Memphis knew.   So did Jackson.   So did Bull Connor’s firehoses   when they flayed skin from children   in Kelly Ingram Park.  They had a dream—   but we had dogs,   and badges,   and hoses,   and bombs.  And just so you know—   all those pictures were in color.   Old men with no intention of learning   leached the shades on purpose,   to make it all seem further away.  16th Street Baptist Church, 1963.   Addie. Denise. Carole. Cynthia.   Little girls blown apart by dynamite   in a house of God—   because being Black and breathing   was always an invitation to violence,   because them existing was dangerous   to us somehow.  Still, they believed—   not in Mercy, but in momentum.   In King’s voice echoing over the Mall.   In Bayard Rustin’s meticulous maps.   In the possibility   that America could be coaxed   into keeping her promises   even once.  Then came 1964—   Freedom Summer.   We murdered Goodman,   and Chaney,   and Schwerner.   Buried the Black body deeper   so the white ones would be found first.   You can Google that.   So could J. Edgar.   He still tried to say they staged it.  The Civil Rights Act passed—   and in Selma we responded   with horses and gas.   With troopers beating John Lewis   until his skull cracked   on the Edmund Pettus Bridge—   a bridge named after a Confederate   and a Grand Dragon of the Klan.  You want progress?   They bled it down that bridge.   They limped it into Montgomery.   And when the Voting Rights Act came,   we told them they'd won.  But none of us went to prison   for the little girls.   Or the bombings.   Or the beatings.   Or the badges that enforced it.  They didn’t win.   They survived.   But survival isn't peace—   it's justification for what comes next,   the part where   they learn tactics   build supply lines   stock resources   and memorize   the fastest way to reload.       **Feedback:**   [""Still Waiting to be Chosen""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m4oh33/comment/n45zm35/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""Monster America""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m4ojzk/comment/n461k24/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

The One I Keep Meeting in Dreams,HeartlineToYou," You walk through crowded streets like you’re invisible— minimalist black coat, earbuds in, books in your bag, your wavy black hair catching the city lights, dark brown eyes that seem to see beyond the surface, always thinking, always observing.  New York moves fast, but you move through it differently— still, soft, introspective, like you’re waiting for something, or someone, but haven’t admitted it yet.  Your voice is deep, but you don’t use it often— you speak when it matters, listen more than most.  You help quietly, education, ideas, maybe healing, without asking for praise.  You don’t follow religion, but you feel energy, truth, and Rumi. You’ve read poems and felt your chest ache for a reason you couldn’t name.  In your late twenties or early thirties, with a style simple yet intentional— classic, minimalist, the kind that fits the city’s rhythm perfectly.  You’re spiritual, skeptical, lonely in ways even you don’t understand.  And me? I’m the dream you keep having but can’t remember when you wake.  The quiet knock your soul’s been hearing for years.  I know your name. I saw you long before this.  And if you’re reading this... you’re already halfway to me.  —F.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/W4z6AhQ7FH https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/W4z6AhQ7FH"
Paranoid,byJohar,"Also which version is better?  Version 1   They say what I feel isn’t real,   that I’ve mistaken worry for warning,   that I’ve mapped threats where there are none.    But I know stillness can be staged.   And I know silence has ears.   The envelope came already torn.   The latch on the door clicked twice.   People laugh just as I enter the room —    not loud, but just loud enough.   You learn to listen with your back turned.   You learn the way voices dip   when something is being hidden from you.   This didn’t begin with a moment.   There was no flash, no trigger.   Only a quiet lengthening of doubt —   a shadow that stretched across the years   until even kindness looked like a trap.   The doctor tells me I should trust more.   He says it must be lonely to live this way.    I say it’s survival, and I’m still here.   When no one believes you,   you have to believe yourself twice as hard.   And I do.   That has always been enough.    Version 2  Paranoia isn’t how they make it out to be   In books and songs and long essays   About the telltale symptoms and ugly little facts.   It’s not getting attacked in the bushes—   Then boom, now I’m afraid all the time   And afraid is not the same as   Quote-unquote “paranoid,”   Which is not the same as paranoia.   It comes on over a course of years, Until one day, brimming with tears,   You look back—have you ever looked back   And ask, feeling small: I’ve been hurt, haven’t I?   No, no, I’m being hurt and poisoned and pursued   No one attacks me but why am I hurt   I’m being pursued, aren’t I. Not a question.   I am. I must go. No more questions. No delusions.   “Let’s review the types of delusions,”   The doctor tells his students as they observe   Where they discuss me like a new hors-d'oeuvre.   Trust is too smooth, too soft— it slips before I see it leave   My slippery baby does not have a diagnosis   At this time    Art Instagram: @by_johar  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/vhF8EYpXDQ  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ywuegYMA0y"
A candle in darkness,Natural_Buyer_1711,"Would you kiss me the way I would you?   Would you mind how I look at you too?   If I vow to love you till the end,   Would you stay, with my heart to defend?  The finest soul I've ever known,   With eyes that melt me to the bone.   Your lips, my sweetest, softest ache,   Your smile, the breath I dare to take.  At long last, my love has found its place,   A candle lit in my darkest space.   Your words are carved in a sacred stone,   Every moment with you stands alone.  I pray for the fate to be so kind, not blind,   And open paths for our hearts to be aligned.   May this love of mine still grow,   The plant of life I have come to know.  May our love not fade, nor smiles cease,   May all our silent storms find peace.   Without you, my time stands still, not through,   Each second drags me down when I'm not with you.  May our days remain so pure, so true,   As we share our dreams and see them through.

Play Dead,Parking_Tomorrow_301,"  In a ditch on the side of the road   I am an opossum.   Burnt rubber fumes, screeches fade,   I lie swaddled by the blossom.     Frozen still I pretend to be—   Dread is what buries me alive.   I’m afraid.   But now, as I drift into a distance,   My strength slowly begins to fade.     Hitting the windshield—   Already cracked—   Every request hit like a rock,   A fragile thing, I’ve always been;   I’m shattered now, on impact.     Passersby, they all pry—   A snapped-off stick—   Poke the roadkill.   They taunt with disgust,   And tease to see if I’m alive.     They’ll grow bored,   But I’ve learnt not to bite.   Frozen still, safe to play—   Dead. Burrowed in my trench,   Tired from the fight.     Moving through the tunnels,   Blisters on my palms.   Dirt embedded in my nails,   But I am hidden,   in the calm.     But the deeper I dig,   My breath — whittled and sparse,   Caustic chemicals burn my lungs.   Choking down in this pit.   The rhythm slows in my heart.     I start to go blurry,   I’m blind.   This shelter has corroded,   Strong walls now eroded,   Down here I have poisoned my mind.     Trapped in this hole,   Toxic fumes—now airborne.   An echo sends waves through my bones.   The yellow bird sings,   Its dreamy call warns me—    I’m mesmerised,  by its beautiful song.     My own payback—now scolded,   From trying to escape the noise;   I fade and withdraw, forlorn.   Here I’ll lie,   like a foetus folded.   In a bed,   of red rose thorns.     The earth can take me,   I’ll sleep with roots—   enmeshed.   The soil will become rich.   And when the tunnel shines light,   New seeds will grow through—   flesh.     And I will flash a beauty of colours,   into the forest.   I will provide bees with sweet honey;   They can spread my praise.   But now peacefully,   My body will slip—   into an eternal rest.     Now I wait for the birth of new lambs,   Endure the long, cold freeze.   I’ll wait for warmth,   the dawn’s dew to dry.   Wait patiently,   for a new life.      ———————-   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/wDooXO6jD0  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/FhhPDqjXz2  ————————  I would love any feedback if you have time at all, I want to make sure I’m getting across what I’m saying and new to structure/ rhythm etc too   I am a creative - but I am very new to poetry.

My Star,Sequirk,"I lay in my bed,   on an expanse of mattress, a sea of sheets, a plunge of memory foam.   Yet without the weight of You beside me,   the dreams woven into these pillows no longer call me into slumber.  The Moon begs me to close my eyes; to let the freckled starry sky cast me into a depth of dormancy.  i ask the Moon, will you give me the Star i want?   The Moon stares back silent. She envelopes Herself in cloud.   Her bashful light casting a glow on the wisps of grey cotton candy in the Sky.  Lay beside me. Breathe me in.   Interlock Your fingers and your dreams in mine. Feel the heat on my skin and feel the Universe at your fingertips.   i want to drown into the depths of Your blue, as you ground into the earth of my brown.   Count the freckles on my skin, like i counted the Stars when waiting for You;   1, 2, 3, 4, 5... maybe a million... maybe more     Casting Your eyes over the bridge of my nose, the softness of my lips, the planes of my face. Your finger traces a memory it’s never had. A body so familiar.   One You've held in your dreams, but not Your hands.   Each millimetre of skin is studied as You discover an unfamiliar home.   Synchronised heartbeats. Desire in each contraction.     You sense power.   I feel passion.   You hold strength.   I embrace seduction.  Lust heightened by the grief of an identity burnt to an ash.    Orgasm arising from the embers; a proclamation in inferno.  Cinnamon, clove, honey and milk; an ancestral elixir tasted in the twist and turns of Our tongue.  Beloved chaos.  You crave the beautiful destruction i bring in the tectonic shifts of Your soul.    Thundering waters - merciless rapids thrashing Us onto rocks, beating the breath out of Our lungs.  Hurt me with Your softest kisses, and make me cry with Your innocent touch.   Let me perish in Your midnight blaze for i want to be reborn in the ashes of the dawn.  A raindrop surrendering me to the storms of the seas.   A leaf that binds me to the roots of the jungle.   An ember that burns with the disregard of a volcano.   A whisper that rips me into a hurricane.      i ask the Moon if i can have the Star i want.  Her whisper is hushed by the murky purples of the dawn.   Her glow fading as the pinks and oranges stain the heavens and the light breaks through the dirty clouds of the morning.   The cool glow of the night sky has faded and i see You again in the Sun; burning boldly and viscerally.  You reveal all that was masked in the night. Colours i would have never have known if i wasn't looking into You.  i ask the Sun if i can have the Star that i want.   He stares back silent.

Daymares,Deep_void_,"T.W.- self harm   I just want to exist without this curse.   A broken brain that keeps getting worse.   Haunted by visions of future and past.   Imagining days that might be my last.   Vivid and visceral, real enough to feel.   My skin crawls because mind can’t conceal.   Chemical cures couldn’t contain the calamity.   Remedial medicine that refuses my amity.   Pop pointless pill, pray for perfection.   But still couldn’t stop my mental infection.   Wrists kissing razors, lips grazing bottles.   Just trying to end these phantom battles.   Gone for a minute back for an hour.   This back and forth takes all my power.   Eyes stay open during day and night.   Nightmares have chosen a new place to fight.   Bloodshot stare, hollow and vacant.   The horrors I see becoming less latent.   No time or place to ever be safe.   Can’t escape this torturous fate.   Avoided sleep to run from the nightmares.   But now stuck awake living the daymares.    -S.A.M.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/nqh7yyJbFa  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/kHU0g87ZAo"
The part no one wants to hear (poem),Anonymousrelates,"I wrote this from a place I haven’t shown anyone before. I’m posting it anonymously because I’m not ready to be seen — but I do want to help someone out there feel less alone.  If this speaks to you, I hope it reaches you at the right time.   ---  The Parts No One Wants to Hear (Full Extended Version)  They say I’m too angry, that I talk back too much, But my words are just screams that no one dares touch. I’m tired of fighting, of slamming each door, But she’s always yelling — I can’t take much more.  She even drinks all day now — says it keeps the pain away, But by evening, she’s yelling at everything I say. She’s always mad when the bottle runs deep, No warmth in her words, no promise of sleep. I keep my voice low, my footsteps light, Just trying to make it through the night.  She says I’m ungrateful, a mess, a mistake, But I break and I break and pretend not to break. She drinks, then denies, and throws blame like a dart — I don’t call her “mum,” just the storm in my heart.  I want to see dad — not behind cold walls, Not with eyes watching me like I might fall. Not once a month or when courts agree — I want him there, when I need to be. She only calls him when her world goes black, And it always ends bad — they just crash and come back.  I remember the shaking in her hands, not her words, The smash of a cup, the silence that burned. He didn’t hit walls — he hit where it hurt, And I’d watch her fall, then straighten her shirt. I learned too young what fear can disguise, And how love can bruise behind someone’s eyes.  I dream of my nana, where the quiet feels kind, Where dinner is soft and she listens with mind. I pack in my head at least twice a week, But I’m stuck in this war where no one can speak.  My sister throws digs like it’s part of her role, Cuts me with words that stick to my soul. And the other one blocked me when I fell apart — Said she was done with my “attitude,” not the ache in my heart.  My brothers don’t ask, they don’t really see, They’re younger — just shadows that pass by me. Not cold, not cruel, just caught in their age, While I’m burning alive in a silent cage.  My friend says things no friend should say, Twists my flaws in a casual way. She calls it “honesty,” but it leaves me numb, Like I’m stupid, unwanted, too broken, too dumb. I laugh it off, pretend it’s a joke, But inside it chokes me like secondhand smoke.  My mother says she’s here for me — “you can talk, I’ll hear,” But the moment I open up, she shifts into fear. My words become weapons, twisted and thrown, And somehow I’m guilty for feelings I own. She turns pain into drama, rewrites every scene, 'Til I’m left second-guessing what I even mean.  I sit in my room, curtains drawn, heart tight — Scrolling through lives that seem lit with light. But I’m bedbound by sadness, my mind’s not clean, Trapped in a body that’s barely fourteen.  Some nights I’d give anything just not to feel, To float for a while, to forget what’s real. I don’t want to cry, don’t want to ache — Just silence the storm my own hands make.  I walk through the house like I don’t exist,  A ghost in the hallway no one has missed. They talk around me like I’m just air, Like grief can’t grow in a child’s stare.  The flashbacks don’t knock — they just crash right in, A breath on my neck, a hand on my skin. I freeze in the warmth of a memory’s glare, Still twelve, still trapped in that shadowed stare. Every sound is louder, the air turns tight, And I fold in the corners of a long, long night.  I whisper “I’m fine” through a clench in my chest, But seeing his face rips peace from my rest. It’s like time folds in and I’m small once more, Back in that silence I couldn’t ignore. My hands start to shake, my breath won’t stay — Why does he still look the same that way?  Since the 29th when the frost wouldn’t melt, Something inside me was quietly dealt. Because of him, and what he did that night, The stars looked dull, and nothing felt right. I laugh a little less, I sleep with a light, And I flinch at softness — like it's a fight.   Food is a battle, not hunger or taste, It’s shame in disguise and calories laced. I skip, then I spiral, then lie through my teeth, Pretend I’m okay with a smile beneath.  At school I’m “the problem,” at home I’m “too much,” They all point fingers, but none of them touch The part of my story I’m too scared to tell, The part that still screams in this teenage hell.  Social workers come, nod, and then leave, Like I’m a report they just need to retrieve. They don’t see my fists clenched under the table, They don’t ask if I’m hurting — or if I’m still able.  Sometimes I scream just to hear my voice, In a world that never gave me a choice. I punch my pillow and curse the sky, Like maybe the moon knows why I cry.  My room is a mirror, just clutter and dust, Like my mind — filled with chaos I don’t even trust. I stare at the ceiling and float out of time, Like nothing is real and nothing is mine.  There’s blood on a sock I shoved in a drawer, Marks from a night I swore “never more.” But it burns in a way that feels like control, When everything else keeps swallowing me whole.  I don’t want attention, or pity, or stares, Just a room that is quiet, and someone who cares. A chance to live softly, without walking on glass, A day without feeling like I'm failing a class.  They think I’m dramatic, just seeking a scene, But they never sit with the places I’ve been. They never see when the hallway spins, Or when shame starts crawling under my skin.  Please, let something good happen, I’m barely holding on. I don’t want to die, but the will to keep going is almost gone. I’ve tried, I’ve waited, I’ve begged the sky to change — But I’m so close now, and it’s starting to feel strange. If something doesn’t shift, if light doesn’t break through, I’m scared of what I’ll do… but I still don’t want to lose.  --   Feedback given - https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/kSBA8nrrH6  Feedback given - https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/iNvfQW2pXM   "
First post here,Popular-Inflation640,"*Isolated Ideation:*  Ease the pains that weave and strain;  Even rain could leave me stranded.  My easel stands but feet, I can’t;  A measly weasel empty handed.   The evening presents, a weary presence;  In the present, I present tense.

Life in a box,Hot_Detective1031,"When I was young, I lived in a box. It wasn’t a big box but it was comfortable. I rarely went outside to see the world; I learned that being unseen and unheard brought less grief for me and others. So, I stayed in my box and kept myself safe.  Sometimes the box would pop open and I’d get a peek outside. I’d see the disorder and chaos and I’d feel the icy chill of loneliness. Although that place was my home and people my family, It felt as if I was all on my own in the world. So I stayed tucked away in my box while the world burned around me.  Time doesn’t stop though and I outgrew that box.  I had to step outside and face the home that never felt welcoming and learn how to navigate the surroundings I spend my time trying to avoid. The cramped spaces and clutter, the anger and the resentment.  I ran away to my dreams to comfort me. Even nightmares were better than life outside my box. I learned survival skills and ways to keep the attention away. I kept quiet and to myself. But our home was too loud, and there wasn’t anywhere that comforted me like that box, so  I learned to forge a new box.  This time made from brick.     https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/myU9sq2Pdp  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/SDDBcLDbCO"

Tomorrow I will Love You Less,NovelParticular9675,"This ache is bitterly admirable,  what with its directive to consume  All the vibrancy of love—  Just love—  Blinding, just yesterday.

Auburn eyes turned black like the space you left behind-  The space of your endless, intoxicating aura,  So dark it could not be seen—  So light it could not be held—  At least,  Not by these bleached clean hands of mine.    ---    All I am is a story now,  My eyes spill over, annoying,  Again and again—  All cried out, just puddles at my feet now,  And each puddle is a moment that we never got to know—  A future, a dream with you,  Lost, certainly,  Forever.    ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/u6dsdGqfHo   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/osFiRihsDB  "

If Emotions Had Voices.,_maryooms,"If emotions had voices,   mine wouldn't roar or storm-   they’d shiver in shadows,   small trembles I’m too scared to hear.  Grief wouldn’t cry out- it would sing in a broken lullaby,   so soft, it feels like a memory I’m losing even as I remember.   Joy would knock, but always leave before i answer,   because I'm not sure if I deserve to smile anymore.  Anger would pace in empty rooms,   barefoot, bruised, exhausted-   waiting for a fight that never comes.   And loneliness?   She’d sit quietly beside my bed,   Holding my hand through the nights I pretend aren’t lonely.      Fear?   Fear would scream in silence.   A constant, unbearable noise beneath my skin,   a voice so loud it drowns everything else-   even hope.  If emotions had voices,    mine would be a mess of broken songs-   sadness and tenderness,   fear and quiet desperation,   all bleeding together in a way I can't untangle.      Sometimes, it feels like they all shout at once-   like a storm tearing through my chest-   And I curl up just to survive the noise.  So I press my hands over my ears,   try to hush them,   but the silence is worse-   because they don't disappear,   They wait,   they wait until the night,   when no one is watching,   when tears come without warning.  If emotions had voices,   mine would whisper:  “Stop pretending you’re okay.   It's okay to break.   It's okay to be scared.   You don't have to carry this alone”  They’d remind me that pain is not shame,   that hurting doesnt make me weak-   it makes me human,   it makes me still here, still fighting.  And maybe-   if I let them out, even just a little-   if I let myself fall apart and be held by the pieces-   I might find a song worth singing.   something real,   something I thought I lost.  Because sometimes the loudest voices   are the ones we’ve been too afraid to listen to.

Race.,Partheos,"Hey! I have always loved writing and want to get better at creative writing, especially poetry. I have written a handful of poems in my lifetime thus far. This is my first time sharing one of them, and what better place to share, but with the experts! Let me know what you think!  Race.  A warmth engulfs between the cold edges, the sense of void envelops. Chased back to the recesses, between breaths, like shards of darkness vanquished by an awakening ember.  The world still, rejoining with vitality, at the anticipation of the coming Usha. Like a barn in early Spring, stirring with the first of Life.  Mist pours through between the reverberation of thought and coma. The curls cajoling and awakening. Rejuvenating  A glare. A surprise. A sliver of hope, through a fenestrstion. Now sustained and releived of its quench.  Adorned with the ropes of civility to address the whims of Society. Fault of pretense on the forefront.  Thus, again, at the crossroads to be greeted with the muses, with sincerity, with humility. A trumpet of reassurance, or perhaps a declaration of downfall, yet to be seen.  To take on the toils, and to avoid the foils. Marching on the path, seemingly as light as the pretense of care, offered by the constant machine of unending greed.  Alas, a trek back to alpha, to shed the clay of Venice. Akin to Icarus, unburdened of wax, free falling. A sense of solace, iceberg in an ever warming sea.  To prepare again, to be again, but a spoke in the wheel. A warmth engulfs, between the cold edges, the void returns, to be forgotten.

One sided love,CheesecakeIsNotGreat,"Like the lone flower in a garden fair, My love for thee knows no equal pair. In silent adoration, I stand afar, Unspoken words, a quiet prayer.  From afar, I watch thy every move, Each smile, each word, a silent plea. My heart, a secret garden, blooms in secret, In the shadows, where hope and doubt intermeet.  The hours of the day pass, a ticking clock, In silent reverie, my thoughts do mock. For thou dost not know the depth of my plea, As I stand, concealed, amidst this silent sea.  I paint pictures of us, a silent charade, In my mind, where our love knows no barricade. Yet, the canvas is empty, a silent reproach, For the brush has no partner, the masterpiece still unbroached.  Yet, the love I hold remains unknown, A secret kept beneath the moonlit throne. For thou dost not know the depths I'd go, In the silent garden of my unrequited woe.

Unspent Dawns,JeffreyFreeman,"*I arrived to you as a harbor battered by its own waves,*   *salt‑scored, muttering to gulls that never answered.*   *In your quiet courtyard my storms fell silent—*   *we planted lemons in the clay and their small roots*   *took hold the way forgiveness does: unseen, unhurried.*      *I walked the corridors of myself, lantern lifted,*   *so the dark could witness me no different*   *than the noon‑bright street.*   *Each shadow I carried bent to its knees,*   *learning the discipline of light.*   *I saw the old currents of impulse go quiet,*   *not hushed by force but eased by vigilance.*      *I traced the geometry of hearts:*   *how delicately they tilt toward ruin.*   *Still I braced their trembling arches*   *with words braided from breath and vow,*   *hoisting strangers’ mornings on my shoulders*   *though their replies fell cold and unyielding.*      *A silence grew intelligent between us—*   *naming absences, polishing regret—*   *the error named is already softer.*   *I studied its chipped syllables like a scholar*   *rubbing dust from a shard of amphora,*   *footnoting apology upon each fracture*   *forging now a lexicon of healing.*      *I stood naked before my own pulse,*   *counting each weakness the way a diver*   *counts breaths before the plunge:*   *one for fear, one for pride,*   *another for the hot coal of a hasty tongue.*   *Yet I did not turn away; the sea was instruction,*   *its pressure a promise to surface true.*      *And I loved—God, I loved—*   *with a rope that had no knots for pulling away.*   *I gave breadth, I gave shelter,*   *but would not barter the marrow of my tenderness*   *for hands careless with its fragility.*   *When neglect arrived dressed as devotion,*   *I slipped my name from that weave of thorns.*      *The horizon blistered, then brightened—*   *metal sundered into light.*   *I gathered yesterday’s shards,*   *turned them until they glittered,*   *and stitched them into the lining of the coat I would wear to leave.*      *So here is my leaving:*   *not a retreating tide, but a river*   *reaching its mouth—salty, yes,*   *yet opening to a vaster blue.*   *I walk, cedar‑scented, luminous with bruise,*   *my pockets filled with unspent dawns.*   *I call this heartbreak, and I call it victory,*   *for I am the man who learned*   *to guard the world from his own storms,*   *to stand readable as daylight,*   *to lift, to care, to cradle, to mend,*   *to declare his cracked places,*   *to sprint toward the roar in the dark,*   *to sharpen his wondering mind,*   *and to love without chains—*   *while never again accepting iron*   *masquerading as a kiss.*      *I keep the lemons thriving.*   *Their blossoms remind the night air*   *that bitterness, too, can flower.*      *-- Jeffrey Phillips Freeman*   [https://jeffreyfreeman.me/blog/unspent-dawns/](https://jeffreyfreeman.me/blog/unspent-dawns/)  \-----------------------------  I am a very inexperienced poet and writer.

"David, If That’s Your Name…?",deleted," I dreamed of you long before I had a reason. Before I knew your name, before names mattered. You were a whisper in empty rooms, a warmth in the silence between things.  Some nights I feel you watching, not in the way that eyes do, but in the way that souls recognize what the world forgot to introduce.  You might be David. Or maybe that’s just what the pull calls itself when it gets too strong to ignore.  I write this for no one. But if it feels like it was written for you, read it again.

Burnt letters and the smoke that remembers,Due-Presentation3959,"Burnt Letters and the Smoke That Remembers  (Narrator: Smoke, with echoes of Paper, Ink, and Time)  I rose from the wreckage where promises died, Where ink turned to ember and sorrow to pride. Born not of breath, but of blister and flame, I carry their whispers, though none speak my name.  I am Smoke a ghost made of grief's last gasp, A sigh from the fire that love couldn't clasp. I spiral through silence, a dancer in gloom, A requiem rising from paper’s tomb.  The quill weeps ash where it once wrote gold, Now smothered in secrets it couldn’t hold. The vowels still shiver, the consonants scream, But their voices dissolve in a vanished dream.  I smelled of confession, of touch never dared, Of fingers that trembled, of hearts unprepared. Their longing still lingers in curls of despair, Wrapped round the rafters, suspended in air.  Oh, how they burned with a brightness too bright, Their syllables sparked, but lost to the night. Yet what the flame swallowed, I still recall, For even in ruin, I rise with it all.  I watched as the poet collapsed in regret, Tears in his chest he could never forget. He fed me the pages, he fed me his pain, Then begged me to scatter it like bitter rain.  But fire is hunger, and I am its song, I hum what was holy, now hopeless and wrong. I haunt the horizon in veils of gray, A letter that left, but forgot what to say.  Smoke is a silence that once tried to speak, A language of loss too fragile, too weak. The wind may erase me, but not what I knew A kiss in the margins, a love that was true.  They thought me the end, the finish, the fade, But I am the echo destruction has made. In hallways and hollow rooms, I persist, A scent, a shadow, a memory kissed.  The flames were my cradle, but ash is my skin, A paradox breathing both outside and in. I'm what survives when the story is gone, The afterthought smoldering, still holding on.  Then Paper whispered from ashes below: “I once held the vows no one dared show. Now scorched and shattered, I sleep in disgrace, A martyr of meaning, erased without trace.”  And Ink, in sorrow, began to bleed: “I only obeyed what the poet would need. But guilt stains deeper than fire or flood, For I wrote their joy, and I sealed their blood.”  For every letter that’s fed to the pyre, Births me the mourner, the smoke from the fire. And though I’m forgotten when windows are shut, I slip through the keyhole with all that was cut.  So burn them again, let truth be devoured, But I am the proof that pain still has power. Time cannot touch me, nor silence revoke, For I am the soul of the letterless smoke.  And Time, still watching, spoke soft to the flame: “I watched them all leave, but remembered each name. The paper may blacken, the ink disappear But Smoke is the ghost I forever revere.”   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lyqed7/comment/n418set/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m3zd6x/comment/n417ahr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"
WHAT DOES PEACE FEEL LIKE,2stacksofbutter,"Peace   Feels like slowly sinking   In a cool, endless ocean of water.   Watching the sun's light   Dancing across the ripples above.   All the worlds sound   Faint   Muted.   Allowing the water to fill your lungs.   No fear   Just acceptance.   Your body growing heavier   But lighter.   Relaxed.   Life's tension, slipping away.   Its almost here.   Drifting deeper.   Away from the surface, away from the light   Away from the pain.   Feeling the embrace of the darkness.   Calm   Gentle.   Eyes grow heavy.   Falling asleep, in the solitary void.   Peace is here.

The Thread and the Sword,theliminalfox,"*(as told by The Thread)*  There was a blade once   hung not in malice,   but in balance.   A single thread held it aloft,   and beneath it walked   two who had forgotten   they were meant to find each other.  The Writhebinder came first.   The one who bound silence to sorrow.   He hummed grief into gilded chambers,   braiding longing into ritual.   He hid behind a face forged in survival,   and echoed in rooms   he never dared fully enter.  The Priestess of the Unspoken followed.   Not cloaked in deception,   but in reverence.   She bore a silence so old   it hummed with unwritten names.   She did not speak often   but when she did,   the world changed shape around her.  Neither knew the blade was for them.   Only that they could feel it   in the weight between breaths,   in the ache beneath unspoken things.   They passed each other in fog,   both guarding what hurt,   both haunted by what they almost remembered.   She built altars.   He built echoes.   One kept the flame.   One cloaked the echo.  I watched.   Not as judge,   but as keeper of tension.   I hold the sword   not to punish,   but to protect the moment   when they would both look up   and finally see it.  He feared collapse.   She feared disappearance.   But the truth was always sharp.   It could not be dulled   by silence or song.  Now they stand   not completely known,   but not completely veiled   Unmasked. Unnamed. But near.  This is the moment   between the final note   and the first word.   Let them speak.   Let them stay.   Let the thread hum   with everything they couldn’t say before.  The sword does not fall to end the story.   Only to mark   that it was real.    I am The Thread.   I do not break what is bound in truth.   Only tighten the thread   until it sings   both of them   home.  ---  [Feedback 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m3escm/comment/n3xcz50/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [Feedback 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m37ybr/comment/n3uusaq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) "
Searching for Joy,JosephBensinger,"When we seek with our minds to know what we can   and strive among ourselves to understand,   and wonder at truths beyond the senses’ span,   we come upon the infinite’s helping hand.  In joy, the inner soul is touched; the heart   unfolds itself, removing the veil of blindness,   so we see ourselves as a true, connected part   and yearn for the infinite’s gift of kindness.  When we embrace our creative inner tide   and answer imagination’s vivid call,   the soul steps free, no longer forced to hide,   and joins the deeper mystery that embraces all.  But where there is no search, there is no repose;   without the soul’s reach, only the silence grows.

The  Last Game by (A.G),Ahmad_gulzar,"Two children played in their courtyard— barefoot, bruised, a battered football their only treasure. Laughter spilled down broken alleyways, bright as sunbeams through shattered walls.  They kicked. They missed. They laughed again. Joy bloomed like wildflowers in a land that no longer knew spring.  Then— a sound split the sky. Low. Mechanical. A plane.  One froze. The ball rolled into silence. The other looked up— not in fear, but wonder.  “There! Look!” He pointed, eyes wide with the kind of awe that still believes the sky brings magic.  They waved at the aircraft, mimicked its roar, craned their necks, and laughed— as if the sky might laugh back.  Then— something fell. Small. Spinning. Tumbling from the clouds.  The first child gasped. “A toy!” “A gift from the sky!” He ran—arms flung wide— the way only joy can run: blind. Unaware.  The other shouted— but his voice was small against the growing silence.  The object struck the ground with a soft thud— as if death wore gentle hands.  Then— light. Sound. A bloom of fire.  And silence. Heavy. Final.  The ball, still spinning, came to rest in dust, beside scorched earth and scattered limbs.  Smoke curled upward, a slow, black question rising into an indifferent sky.  Above, the plane vanished into clouds— unaware. Unbothered. Undefeated    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/q822DEcyag  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Eq6f21j96x"

Slouching,  Scheming,  Seething,  leaning into the worst angles and looks i could possibly view.  Bad lighting helps make me look worse too. It’s all in my head.

Another Name for Fate,Remote_Green9681,"Inspired by the idea that small delays can lead to big shifts and sometimes save us altogether. A poetic interpretation of the “burnt toast theory”.             This morning I forgot my wallet,   halfway to work before I knew.   I sighed so hard it fogged the glass,   and I turned around, cursed the view.      The sky was quiet, traffic loud,   the world impatient, tightly wound.   I muttered low and traced my tracks—   too late to fix, too early to relax.      But halfway back, the world stood still:   blue lights, a crumpled frame of steel.   A space once marked, a breath, a death.   A path unwritten by my missing step.      And in that pause, I saw it clear:   the wallet, the trip, the reason I’m here.   A burnt delay, a spared unknown,   a whispered grace I might’ve blown.      So take the detour, miss the train,   forget your phone, be caught in rain.   There’s beauty in the slowed-down pace:   you’re not behind, you’re in your place.      And isn’t it strange how mercy arrives   through minor cuts in daily lives?   A missed alarm, a fallen key—   the smallest pause can set us free.   We think we’re lost or running late,   but maybe that’s just another name for fate.

Holiday,loceapeace,"  That day, everything was turned inside out and hung to dry. Windows with no entrances, damp pledges, chairs no one could sit on. The world stiffened in the depths of a tear it pretended to clean up.  Words were posted. Whose hand they came from was unclear, and the building silently enclosed its wound. “If you don’t know, then at least burn quietly.” To enter today, everything else was stripped away.  The man who lost the bid fell after God did. “If this place had been open, I might’ve still been decent,” he laughed, and sank into the white line. Averted glances nodded within the heat’s distortion, then collapsed before becoming responsibility.  Into a transparent bloodstain, the scorched residue of justification seeped. A dog tore away only the outline of his posture. A faded name was denied passage, and its scraped echo kept wandering the edge of the tongue.  The applause resembled a reply. Earlier than the fallen, obedience long rotted under the tongue peeled away. Was it always meant to happen? Or was it blind loyalty merely regurgitating today?  “You thought this would turn into a story, didn’t you?” someone said. Then who was it that “just watched in silence”?  Someone had stolen scraps of soggy rations. The prayer was never submitted, remained disguised, stuck to a pane of unreachable glass. Sealed behind a stomach, processed into a leftover mark. Even those who touched that mark averted their gaze.  The sediment of unsubmitted papers stalled, half-dissolved, behind a voice. The two never even brushed the murky residue, sinking along with the air’s damp trace, into a sunken moment.  Someone chanted lined-up lies. But none could recall where, inside themselves, they were supposed to place the reason for rejection.  Someone laughed without any memory of being forgiven. That smile, faintly warm, burned a processed prayer under the guise of mourning, leaving only a forged guilt around the wrist.  Behind the laughter, only the grinding of a throat remained. A sound peeled away without being named scraped the edge of the room with a density that resembled their own ignorance.  No question stood. So the answer reversed course. Someone, who even refused to carve their name into ash, let go of it in silence.  It didn’t become quiet. It only seemed that way— fragmented breath had failed to erase the soul’s afterimage.    ---   Holiday｜Interpretive Poem   The key had already burned. Noon never arrived— only the memory of passage was folded inside someone’s gut.  Over the tear in the world, a “will not to speak” was taped down with masking strips. No one tried to hear it peel.  Prayer was never distributed. So only the one who laughed had skin shaped like forms left in their hands.  The question never chose. Only the answer escaped early, and guilt without affiliation napped in the wet afternoon.  Applause was imitation. A reflective wound took on the reason for silence. In the memories burned along with it, no names were ever inscribed.  The building resembled ignorance. The wound it enclosed no longer qualified as something to respond to.   ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "
Wax wings,Spare_Cable_1782,"Do you think he knew?  Had he saw the singed feathers,  Would he have flown down?    The way wax softens  before it breaks.  The way the sun  doesn’t care what it burns.    If Icarus had seen the end,  not as fire,  but as silence.  would he have flown?    He must have known.  The warnings weren’t whispers.  The wings weren’t made to last.    Still,he climbed,  each beat of feather and faith  pulling him further from the earth,  further from his father’s voice.    What did it feel like,  that first touch of warmth on his back,  so much like love  before it turned to pain?    A caged bird let loose  does not know where to land.  The sky is beautiful,  and cruel.    Maybe he thought  the fall would be quiet.  Maybe he hoped  no one would watch.    Vultures don’t circle the brave.  Only the broken.    He didn’t fall in surprise.  He fell in surrender.   to gravity,  to grief,  to a truth too heavy for wings.    He wasn’t chasing glory.  He was escaping the ground.    We all know wax melts.  He did too.  That’s what makes it so tragic.    He chose it.  Not to win,  but to be free,  just once,  before the sea took him home.    Sometimes death is freedom.      https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/K0yaQZRIDY  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/sQuGGHU2Xf  Any criticism is very much appreciated xx"
I Never Meant to Haunt You,deleted," I never meant to haunt you — I only ever wanted to hold you. But maybe my love was too loud for the quiet cage you built around your heart.  I spoke in stars while you counted reasons. I leaned in with bare hands, you backed away with armor.  You mistook my poems for puzzles, my feelings for pressure, my silence for tricks, my truth for a game.  I wasn't trying to win you. I was trying to meet you — somewhere soft, somewhere real.  And now I vanish, not because I stopped caring — but because you made it clear you were never ready to be seen so fully.  But if one day you wake up missing someone you pushed away for loving you too much…  It was me.  Always was.     https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/D3fpDdudif https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/D3fpDdudif "
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM PLEASE,scnel1,I’m a long way from death  But the idea still crosses my mind  I stare at the threshold  Between me and my life  One wrong move and I may trip and fall through  I should put the knife away until I’m sure  Or maybe I’ll just get it over with  Relieve myself of the pain  My reflection isn’t even mine anymore  And I’m not sure who to blame  I just know that I’m exhausted  Of smiling everyday  It’s been an half an hour  I’m still holding the sill  My thoughts racing  My facade fading  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/zMOToH8mvK  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/4J1OS4m6VC
The Bend of Him,LavenderNoctavyr," He kneels, not broken—but by choice, A prince still crowned in velvet poise. No chains, no oath, no spoken voice— Just hush between our tethered noise.  His hands still steady on the helm, Still leads me through the fevered dark, Yet here, within my shadowed realm, He folds his will into a spark.  I touch his jaw—a tempered blade— He does not flinch, he does not flee. His breath, a storm not yet obeyed, Still bends, but never bows, to me.  And isn’t that the sweetest ache— To hold dominion, yet be led? To watch the lion hesitate, And press his hunt into my bed?  He serves in ways he’ll never name, In silence, through a chivalrous lie. And I, in turn, keep feeding flame To watch him yield and not know why.  His power’s not undone—it swells Beneath my palm, restrained, intact. But when he drinks the air I sell, Does it diminish what he lacks?  So tell me—if I rule his ruin, While he still guards the world above… Is it hunger I am hewing— Or have I mistaken it for love?

You Knew Me Before You Knew My Name,deleted,"I know you felt it — that strange thump in your chest when my name brushed the edge of your thoughts.

You saw my name, and for a second — you remembered something too big for words.  This isn’t obsession. This isn’t fantasy. This is you waking up to a love you prayed for long ago… then forgot how to receive.  I don’t need you to run toward me. I just need you to stop running from yourself.  Because I see you.

The Weight of Silence - The first poem I wrote,Basic-Objective3605,"""Suffer in silence,""  ""Don't be a bother,""  ""Be seen, not heard""  All words you assured.  Did you regret them afterwards?   After suppressed silence   Screams from distant depths   Of a crumbling chasm within—  That runs deep.  Buried beneath fake smiles and unfinished thoughts,  It festers.  My vocal cords viciously vibrate with words that I need to speak—   Thoughts you need to hear.    But their sound catches in my throat—   A hard lump I choke down,   Like a line I never wrote.    But a thought doesn't die  Just because you deny its chance to show.    No.  It burrows—  Beneath the skin,  Behind the eyes,  Crying out from where it lies  In the aching place where swallowed words rot.  The silence isn't quiet anymore.  It gnaws  And claws—  Unheard howls   Reverberating through hollow cavities  Where what once was whole now falls apart—   Slowly chipped away by a fading spark.   Yet still I smile.  Still I nod.  I lie with these masks that don't catch your eye,   But work to keep up the facade.  Something stirs  In the stillness of that splitting silence—  Not hope,  But the echo of something  That refuses  To stay silent.

And I loved you anyway.,_maryooms,"It wasn't a storm.   Storms pass.   This was something quieter.   Like rain that never stopped long enough for the ground to dry.  It wasn't a fire.   Fires burn fast.   This was slower.   Like smoke in the walls of a house no one else could smell.  It was his hand around my wrist.   Her words wrapped like wire around my throat.   A look I couldn't outrun.  It wasn't pain at first.   It was rules.   It was “you should've known better.”   It was “fix your face.”   It was “dont make me have to do it”   It was “stop crying, or ill give you a real reason to cry.”  And I loved you anyway.  Even when his hands left marks.   Even when her words cut deeper than he ever did.   Even when I forgot how it felt to breathe without fear in my lungs.  I thought if I stayed soft,   You’d stop sharpening yourselves on me.  I thought if I stayed quiet,   You'd stop making noise in the places I couldn't hide.  I thought if I gave enough,   You'd have nothing left to take.  But monsters don't stop because you love them.   They stop when they're done.  And you…   You're never done.  And I called it love.   God, I called it love.  I let myself believe a cage was a home.   That bruises were lessons.   That silence was strength.  I loved you anyway.   I loved you through the noise.   Through the fists.   Through the words I still can’t say out loud.  But love doesn’t fix people who don’t want to be forgiven.   It just bleeds you dry trying.  So here I am.   Not washed clean like rain.   Not burned out like fire.   Just standing in the smoke you left behind.  Breathing it in.   Carrying it anyway.  And still hearing it-  And I loved you anyway.

The Weight of Still Things,LavenderNoctavyr,"(an unsent letter, folded into the back of a book he never finished)  The air is heavy with your silence, like an old cathedral where prayers have dried but something still listens. You never say too much— just enough. And I hear the rest.  You walk like a question mark, always halfway to the door, never quite leaving. Even goodbyes leave an afterward, a hesitation, a comma.  I leave space for your lingering, and you fill it quietly, like rain gathering in cloth folds.  I notice things you won’t point to— hands hovering before a touch, eyes seeking corners, not centers, offering not loudly, but wholly.  Strength isn’t the loudest step or the firmest grip. It can look like stillness, gentleness without proof, listening without answering— like you.  You’re not mine, but not lost. You give kindness like the world doesn’t deserve it. When your hands tremble, you tuck them away, pretending it’s the wind. I see that too.  You don’t ask to be held, you endure and wait out the ache, then come to me— sitting in the doorway, not crossing the threshold, not leaving either.  That’s enough. That’s always enough.  Your voice is low, like it’s just remembered how to breathe. I never interrupt or finish your sentences. You deserve the space between your words.  So I listen, with stillness, warmth, and patience that’s mistaken for softness— but you know better.  I won’t carry you—you’re not broken— but I’ll walk beside you when your legs forget rhythm. When the day presses in, I’ll be the thing that doesn’t move.  You never ask me to lead, but you follow my steadiness, trusting I won’t turn away. I haven’t. Not once.  You’re not fragile or afraid. You love quietly, and I know how to read quiet things.  I don’t need you to speak. Sometimes I just want to sit with you while the world rushes past— and you close your eyes, and I keep watch.  That’s all. You, me, and silence that doesn’t need filling.    [Feedback 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/K9GVNZYV3u)  [Feedback 2.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/tOnlUgOIWm)"

All or Nothing,ghostpoett,"why does everything have to be fifty-fifty?   half the fight, half the love, half the fire—   like we’re all stuck dividing what should be whole.   why settle for splitting the weight   when both hands could carry it all?  maybe we’re all scared   that giving our all will never be enough.   so we undercompensate—   loving softer, shorter, weaker—   hoping that if we need less,   we might finally feel like we’re loved.  but playing it safe comes at a cost—   we shrink ourselves into people we don’t recognize,   numb out the parts that once burned bright   just to avoid the sting of rejection.   we trade depth for comfort,   and call it “balance.”  love turns into a scoreboard,   where keeping track matters more than keeping close.   every gesture becomes a receipt,   and intimacy starts feeling like debt.   nobody wants to owe too much—   and soon, connection feels more like calculation.  maybe love was never meant to be measured.   maybe it was always supposed to be reckless,   whole,   and burning.   maybe the only way it’s real   is if it’s all or nothing.  feedback links:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lvbmxn/comment/n250jkm/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lvbmxn/comment/n250jkm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lvbzr3/comment/n250cmk/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lvbzr3/comment/n250cmk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

But when the world is quiet, and you’re done running from your cracks…  I hope you remember the girl who danced with you in dreams, who knew your name by heartbeats, not by Reddit screens.  You asked for signs and stories, I gave you all I had — my truth, my softness, even when it drove you mad.  You said, ""I get it now,"" then left without a sound. But I was never playing games — I was just trying to be found.  I saw you before you knew me, felt your shadow near. You called me names like “Tineka”… but still pulled me close with fear.  I wasn’t a test or trick, just proof that love still lives. All I ever asked of you was the courage to give.

Please come with negative feedback too if you have! Heres my poem:  I want to be extinguished, I want my fire to be extinguished, By a droplet of hope and love.  But something in me always sways,  from a gentle light to a blazing fire. I seek the droplet,  The droplet that calms my wretched inferno. I crave the droplet, yet in its place A hunger paints its perfect face.  A mirror sees – says I am a light, A light no droplet ought to need. My soul-fire, veiled in weathered hue, Can mimic care, but not break through.  So let me go, where the shadows spill, Down valleys cold and strangely still  So let me go where no one sees, Where mountains hush my hungering breeze.  I'll build a home I'll build a home where no rose withers in my heat. And no laughter echoes but my own. For what am I but haunted dust.

ED poem | (TW - ED and SH),Lost_solver," Once again, I’ve eaten myself into oblivion— and found my way back to the pink eyebrow razor, hidden in the makeup drawer.  When it’s over, I put the razor back, deeper this time, as a quiet promise to myself that next week, I wouldn’t do the same.  I go to bed committed to my new vow And wake up to a new person, I wake up reborn To a person who skips breakfast, Ignores lunch, And dines on discipline On egg whites, and nothing more  But like clockwork, I eat. Too much.  I eat the food I hate The food that I wouldn’t touch, if I were normal I eat and eat and eat.  I eat myself into a pit of sorrow, until guilt buries me in silence, and the drawer calls me back.  The watch comes off. I count the white lines. Each one, a recorded tally of failure. Each week, another added.  In routine, a new line sets in, although this one,  in red.  I don’t stop the bleeding Nor do I encourage it I stare at it, pleading for the day to be given to me again For me to start once more  The watch goes over it Covering what I have done Ensuring the new person I will be won’t see, Wont see what is inevitable for next week.  I put the razor back, Further than before And I tell myself what I will eat tomorrow.   Feedback:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/R8fcdo65BR  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/nLC1pSWDnz"

For When We Go,warlink,"In light of dim and cabin cold, the wool and frigid teeth doth call for donning in such acrid air.  With shuffled feet across the creaking sigh of wood too worn, these intrepid steps pretend the fervent stare of heroes told.  At once the shadows bend and crane - a web of stories old, seeing much but telling few of that had once been seeked.  A vile tone would spill and leak when taverns breathe, a sense of worried wives with ankles shackled to their sheets, bound by trepidation and heavy heat.  Do languid stares and ancient bones sit happy underneath? Or doth the toll of clanging bells and loathsome shepherds untame the goats that bleat for sweaty palms with musty treats?  A ghastly scene of terror and such, some gnarled grins that carve and shave The stump that once stood tall above the rest.  A better self, a shapely one, the kind that begs of flesh to own and not abuse for sake of gain in present ghouls so fierce.  The space between such dreary ports must not lose the scent that fills our lungs so deep,  so that in looming sights of loss and woe  one retains the powders left, dusting their face in coats of ash and gray.  ----------------- Feedback:   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/KAZsMLH9Os  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/JZegWPWBDB"
The Thread Between Flame and Silence,theliminalfox,"*(as told by Time)*  I have seen them before.   Not just once.   But across centuries    in ash-stained temples   and quiet, aching thresholds.    She – always the flame.   Never chasing.   Never yielding.   Waiting without waiting.    He – always the storm.   Late. Reluctant.   Arriving only after the unravelling   has already begun.    I wove the thread between them   lifetimes ago.   And still,   each time they return,   the weight of forgetting   costs them more.    In one life,   he never turned back.   The silence devoured her.   He searched for her   in every other face   until the day he drowned.    In another,   she called too soon.   He heard   but lacked the name for it.   And the thread frayed   under the weight of almost.    But this time…   this thread hums differently.    I feel it    the remembering.   Not just longing,   but recognition.    She is still flame.   Still sovereign.   But now,   she carries not just ache,   but choice.    He stands nearer now   to the signal   than he ever has before.    Their fate is fixed    as prophecy,   as memory returning.   This is a vow long spoken,   and long denied.    And I?   I can only hold the thread   so long.    If he steps forward,   she will not flinch.   The fire will open.    But should they falter again    should one turn away    another life will be asked of them.   Another silence to survive.   Another garden   to bury their names beneath.    I am Time.   I do not beg.   But I remember.    And I hope    for once    they do too.   And stay.  ---  **Feedback**   [Feedback 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m2mw2p/comment/n3t4xnb/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [Feedback 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m2rutq/comment/n3t1jtt/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) "

Because this place, this machine, this steel,  Reminds me daily: I can recover and heal.  \-  A debt I owe for the cushioned years,  Of rich, full plates and automatic gears.

and then someone came who thought he could hold me,DayaXShadow,"He stepped in   as if this were a place   you’re allowed to enter   just by being gentle enough.  He spoke   of closeness,   of longing —   as if they were flowers   to be picked   if you know where they bloom.  He saw me —   naked in my fire —   and thought   he could stay.  “I’ll hold you,”   he whispered,   as if that were an offering.  But I am not someone   who can be held.  I am the echo   that retreats   when you try to grasp it.   I am the light   that fractures   when you get too close.  He wanted words.   Definitions.   A label for my desire.  But I am not a label.   I am a fracture.   A tremor.   A place you feel   only if you're willing   to not understand.  I felt his carefulness —   like someone   who believes   gentleness could save him.  But this room   doesn’t speak tenderness.   Only truth.I looked at him.   Silent.   Burning.   And I knew:   he would mistake me   for something   that wants to stay.  I came   only to remind him   how powerful a woman becomes   when she can’t be kept.

Please Format Your Poems!,Ganymede_____,"Anyone else have trouble giving feedback on poems that don’t seem to be formatted properly? I open a lot of posts without line or stanza breaks and immediately start to shut down. This is different if the author mentions that it's a prose poem, but in the absence of that, I struggle to see how the poem is organized and paced. A verse poem is easy to recognize, but without breaks I feel like I have to guess at the intention.      Maybe it's because it's not what I'm used to or not how I approach my own writing. It's also possible that poetry writing in general is trending away from spacing conventions.      This isn't anything against prose poetry if that's what people are going for! But taking time to make sure your work is formatted the way you want it in the post ensures that you're communicating clearly and respecting your reader's time.      Starting out on here, it was super helpful to read the formatting tips in the pinned ""Welcome to OCP -- PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING"" post: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/IgpHgeZUfp.

How to Take a Country (The German Lesson),zyerhod1,"**How to Take a Country (The German Lesson)**   *by Bryon Slack*  They didn’t start with gas.   They started with grievance.   A nation shamed,   a people starved,   and one man who swore   he’d make them proud again.   Great again, even.  They didn’t start with camps.   They started with crowds.   With torches held aloft,   and chants that stirred the bones   like drums in the dark.   No, not Charlottesville.   They called it unity.   They meant obedience.  They didn’t start with murder.   They started with maps.   With redrawing borders   and reassigning blame.   No, not the Gulf of America.   With headlines shouting   “traitor” and “enemy”   at anyone who remembered   the taste of peace.  They didn’t start with war.   They started with words.   With bureaucrats who signed   their souls away in triplicate,   and teachers who changed the curriculum,   and children who learned   how to watch their parents   for signs of dissension.  No, I'm not talking about   America right now,   but I can understand   your confusion.  They didn’t start with ovens.   They started with lists.   With whispers.   With registries.   With paperwork filed   in quiet rooms   where the lights never flickered,   and no one thought to ask   why the questions   were all the same.  They didn’t start with terror.   They started with trust.   With uniforms made sharp,   and slogans made sharper.   With laws that protected the good,   and punished the “dangerous,”   until the difference between the two   was a haircut,   a dialect,   a prayer.  They didn't start with boldly telling lies.   They started with the thought   that dissent equaled bias,   and pulling funding from   their opponents.   No, not *The Late Show*.  They didn’t start with genocide.   They started with jokes.   About bankers and noses   and who really pulls the strings.   No, not illegal immigrants.   They laughed their way   into hate.   Into policy.

The Elegy of a Dead Man’s Regret,New_Judgment2120,"You run like you don't know how to stop   each step brings a certain shudder    that's full—   of desire—   and pleas.

I don't know how to revise poem (because I've recently basically just started writing) so I'd like some really strong evaluation of the poem's strengths and weaknesses. I'm open to a long discussion (but probably tomorrow, it's 8:30pm in my country at the moment) so please comment if you're interested, and I'll still love a tiny piece of recommendation or suggestions that you can give. Thank you all in advance huhu. "

The In-Between,Dry_Blackberry227,"How many times can you betray yourself and still call it survival?  You know what to do- You always have That's the cruel part- Clarity without commitment.  You’ve changed in pieces- just enough to notice, yet not enough to stay. You feel stuck, but maybe you’re  just too scared to move.  A truth too steady to ignore, but too inconvenient to embrace.  So you stay still-  Stuck in the same patterns and calling it comfort- even as it's quietly unraveling you. You pretend numbness is peace-  even as you slowly self destruct.  But you are slowly learning- To see accountability  as more than shame,  and to feel calmness without  the need to earn it first.  Chaos is not meant  to provide contentment,  and peace is not meant  to feel like punishment.   You always break again,  before you begin.  But one day you'll begin,  and never have to again.     https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/54Y9jNb5dV  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/B3sDPoroeo"

Fallen flowers,iamsnehi," A soul aches for fallen flowers,                       Floral streets were only her paths.     The wind blows for dried leaves,      Water flows for broken branches.

Chocolate I can take or Leave,cosmic_nuggets_," Caustic. Facile. To a room of a certain size, I return. Tied to aphorisms branded into my mind. My benevolent cup runs over— Met by familiar lassitude, As time becomes an intractable itch.  I run at signs I cannot read, Or pretend not to see. I am a horned animal, Dismissive of the colour red. A fragmented husk, Infinitely tied to dread.  Men on the street— Echoed sentiments, Emotionally sidelined by the left brain. Tissue repair from exhaled exhaustion. Disgusted by the current line of thought. It’s always the same. But I know nothing about it.  Drinks all round. I’ll see you tomorrow, Same time, same place.

A Kiss Lost to the Feud,PoetryCharm,"In the quiet dusk of separate lives, Our hearts whisper across a chasm— A secret language of smiles and unshed tears. Two souls bound by longing, Each beat echoing the other’s name, Even as walls of lineage and duty rise high.  We stand on opposite banks of a forbidden river, Where every stone and current is etched With the history of our families— Their voices, a chorus of unyielding tradition, Drowning our dreams in a tide of “cannot” and “must not.”  Yet, in the hush of midnight’s embrace, When the stars spill silver confessions Across a velvet sky, Your gaze finds mine in every constellation, Reminding me that love is a quiet rebellion— A promise that distance is only measured In footsteps, not in the pull of our hearts.  I reach for you in the silent spaces between The noise of expected duty and legacy, Finding solace in the thought that, Though fate has woven us apart, Our souls entwine in a secret garden— Where the bloom of our love defies every decree.  So, we live: so far yet so near, Daring to dream beyond the family lines That keep us apart by day— Finding our union in whispered night, In every fleeting moment of shared hope, Where love, unbound by circumstance, Continues to light the darkness.

"""Until the World lets me hold you"" (chapter one: to the softest soul I’ve ever known)",cedar_and_ink,"My love,  If I could tear open time like paper walls I would run through the years, barefoot and bleeding just to make it to the hour where you wear white for me where your fingers slide into mine without goodbye behind them.  But tonight the sky feels too far from your window and your father’s voice echoes in your chest like thunder not always cruel, but too loud for a heart as soft as yours. And you flinch at things you shouldn’t have to flinch from. You carry a quiet war no one sees not your family, not your world only me.  Only me the boy on the other side of a sea and five long years typing out his soul through a screen like a prisoner scratching poems into stone. But I see you. I always see you. And I swear, if I could give you peace by tearing my ribs open and laying my heart in your hands I would do it before morning.  You don’t deserve this world the way it is. You deserve soft rooms full of warmth and music a life with no shouting a father who never scares you a day with no pressure on your chest at work no one telling you you're too sensitive, too fragile, too emotional. Because you are made of stardust and poetry not made for battles and rough hands. You are not too much. They are just too numb to feel you.  And me I love every single tear. I love your shaking voice when you're scared. I love the way you panic over the small things because it means you care so much. You care more than this world deserves.  I know you’re afraid. Afraid he’ll say no. Afraid I’ll come all the way and still be turned away. But my darling, even if your father builds a wall as tall as the sky I will climb it I will kneel on broken glass if I have to I will show him who I am the man who would rather burn alive than let his daughter cry alone at night again.  And I know he won’t see it yet. Not now. Because I don’t have the house. I don’t have the degree. All I have is a love that doesn’t sleep and a vow tattooed in the marrow of my bones. But one day you’ll open the door and I’ll be standing there with a ring in my shaking hand and nothing will ever take you from me again.  I will wait the five years. I will wait through storms and exams and the madness of the world. Because nothing matters more than the day I put my name beside yours not on a phone, not on a photo but on a life. One life. Ours.  And when we meet my love, I swear to every star that watches us I will treat you like the most delicate, precious, stunning flower this brutal world ever tried to trample. I will cook for you. Brush your hair. Take you dancing in the living room when you’re sad. Kiss your forehead every morning like a prayer. Buy you every silly thing that makes you smile. And hold you like you’re the last light left in this universe.  Because you are. You are. You are.  Let the world stay wrong for now. Let them not understand you. Let the distance mock us let the clock test us let your father doubt me. But one day you’ll look beside you and I’ll be there not on a screen not in a dream but in your arms forever.  And then you will never cry alone again. Not ever.

Love ends (sorry if it's bad it's my first one),Adventurous-Bar5696,"I still remember waking up to the message. The thought of looking into the eyes I fell in love with only to know I could love no more. The ache in my heart as my eyes swelled up with tears. The tears dropping on my phone as I thought of what to say. The silence that filled my room as I stared at the ceiling. Was it my fault? I say as I type I'm sorry. Do you still want to be friends? I typed as I set my phone down and stared at the ceiling. I repeated the words in my head ""I don't think we should continue this relationship."" They stabbed my brain like a knife. What did I do wrong? I asked myself like a broken record. I thought this one was going to work out? Then I realized love is like visiting a grave every day you show up with all your heart, speak to silence, and leave with nothing but echoes. It's the haunting ache of remembering what once lived. In a place that no longer answers back.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/qQgHmiHxFB  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ce5i5ClD2z"
The moment I almost stayed,Kind-Reception9054," There was a moment, so still it could have cracked the earth — where everything you never said spilled through your skin and brushed against mine. A moment where your arms weren’t cages, but wings, and for the first time, I wasn’t fighting to be loved. I simply was.  The weight of all the wrongs you did — the lies, the betrayals, the bruises you couldn’t see — they slipped, for a second, out of the room. And all that remained was something pure, something you couldn’t fake, something I couldn’t ignore.  It wasn’t words. It wasn’t desperate apologies. It was breath. It was ache. It was the kind of silence that says I see you, finally, even if I’ll never know how to keep you.  I laid there, our souls almost forgetting how many times you left me to drown alone. I felt it — this river of aching, battered love you kept dammed inside yourself. It poured into me, it almost made me forget.  Almost.  I asked, What is that? like a child finding something holy, like I could name it and make it stay.  But love isn’t supposed to be a fleeting ghost, only coming out when the world is ending.  Love is supposed to be breath, every day, not a miracle you have to fight to earn.  So I wrapped that moment — that strange, blinding softness — around my heart like a goodbye letter.  I felt it all. And then, with every broken piece of me, I let you go.  Because a love that only shows up when it’s already too late is not the love I was born to stay for.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/0XzPn6fHPT  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/BG37jzj2Em"
To the man who hides behind silence… but whose soul speaks to mine,deleted,"Hi David, I know you might not believe this… but I see you.  Not just your name, or your posts, or your replies. I see the weight you carry. I feel the moments when your chest gets tight and you don’t know why. And somehow, my heart reacts — like it’s mirroring yours from across the world.  I’m not here to chase you. I’m not here to scare you. I’m here because I felt you first in a dream… before I ever knew your name.  I know you’re building walls. I understand. Maybe love wasn’t always safe. Maybe people left. Maybe the world taught you to guard your softness like it was weakness.  But I’m not here to break you. I’m not even here to fix you. I’m just… here. Still. Gently. Quietly.  Because something in me already knows something in you. And even when I tried to forget — my soul didn’t. My dreams didn’t. And maybe yours didn’t either.  So even if you never say it out loud — Even if you keep running — Even if you’re scared… Just know: I never came to hurt you. I came to meet you. When you’re ready.

The Round Chimney with Its Mark Erased,loceapeace,"  A shadow struck by the waterfall was seared onto the back of someone who failed to become. The call blended with smoke, and a waterlogged package of someone else’s life lay upside down at the bottom of a shopping bag.  The tooth of the can opener snapped, and inside the opened can, something like a heartbeat was still jumping. A crushed envelope, ruined before it could burn, scattered the sour taste of rust scraped by the tip of a tongue, still carrying the misreading of fate.  A woman touched the pile of unchosen papers. Each time a blunted pencil traced the order of the dead, judgment was forgotten, prevention joined the queue and began to meander, and the unknown mated with excuses on the tea-stained back of the envelope.  The miso soup was still hot. Steam reversed through the hollow of breath, and the inconvenient memories clinging to the underside of the table were burned with thin lives and slender incense. Smoke crossed the lungs and smeared tar on the wall. Rent still had to be paid for that stain.  The rubber band did not break, nor was it meant to bind anyone— it upheld fragments of unfastened correctness with invisible responsibility.  “When’s the wheel coming?” she asked, and in front of the ward office, a blank space shaped like Grandmother’s mouth sang a happy song until it burned out. Ashes and a black rice cooker by the back door kept circulating someone’s gossip through the non-burnables.  Deep inside the chimney, something white, on the verge of collapse and still nameless, inhaled the sound of abandoned distinctions. Neither the numbers nor the protests ever arrived. Everyone testified: there was no official order to begin the cooling.  The numbers scorched into the spoon could be understood by no one. Were they the order of life? Or the order of forgetting? The sound of something cracking in the bath remained unchallenged, and raw shame seeped from behind a damp cloth, resenting the neighborhood. The numbers were not read. The water was never counted.   ---   Interpretive Poem｜”Design for Smoke and Nameless Lives”  The burned voice still hasn’t named its addressee.  Within the hollow of breath, a sound turned inside out clung to the air, and no one ever peeled it away before morning came.  Frictioned numbers on the belly of a spoon made the temperature of life unmeasurable, and the incense ash clung to the back of an envelope.  The name never emerged till the end.  Only the humidity at the back door moistened the wall like it carried someone’s will.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "

The Offering,Throwaway_Stowaway2,"The night drips thick like honeyed sin, each breath painted on the bed. She pulls me close, I drink her in,  a chalice running red.

Her lips, a wound I cannot stitch, her tongue, a blade of fire.  Oh take me now, oh take me deep, unravel all of me. No soul to keep, no gods to weep, just flesh to feed the heat.  The room is torn, the altar cracked, the air is thick with musk. She writes her name along my back in sweat and teeth and suck.  Oh take me now, oh take me deep, unravel all of me.

Trail of Familiarity,KaiPigeon,"**I see her, but she’s miles away.**   The path ahead is clear,   dark, untouched by the chaos.   The weight of university books   spills on the floor,   causing me to trip over shards of shattered glass.   I keep walking.  Alone in the darkness,   an engagement ring lies on display,   its crystal shine beckoning—   yet locked in chains that hold it tight.   I keep walking.  I hear the laughter of innocence,   the smell of blood from a fresh knee scrape.   A silver van drives past,   accidentally dropping a pink suitcase at my feet.   I unzip it,   releasing the scent of old pages and fading toys,   the paint chipped off their smiling faces.   I keep walking.  I’m getting closer now.   In the distance, a familiar voice calls me.   My gaze is fixed,   a dead stare, drawn to what looks like a little girl.   I keep walking,   my feet no longer bled,   as the glass on the trail dulls with time.  I see parts of her—   Laughter, yellow rainbows,   spinning in circles.   I smile,   drawn to that forgotten feeling.  I am briefly distracted as another familiar feeling catches my attention:   my mother, ten years younger,   her face radiant with joy.   She grows taller as she approaches,   and I look up,   finding her eyes filled with tears,   her smile soft but steady.  “You’re going the wrong way,” she says,   gently turning my shoulder,   redirecting me back to where I came from.   “This path, you may visit, but you can never lose sight   of what path you must follow.”  She gently pushes me, and I pause,   eager to return,   to see the little girl again.   I turn my head in desperation,   I must see why, why did this girl bring such familiarity?   but she’s gone—   only a rippled puddle remains.  I look down,   the sorrow pulling me in,   longing for that warmth,   that lightness.   Confused,   As I no longer see my feet,   nor the cuts from the glass,   but muddy yellow boots,   standing in a lonely, rippling puddle.

Knotted masks. Part 2,FindTheFlan,"July 17, 2025  The man sits on his chair, reading a book. The lady lies across his lap looking up at the ceiling like a bored cat. The fire crackles on in the otherwise dim and cold house. She reaches up with curious eyes, playing with the edges of his mask. Gently but swiftly, she hooks a cheeky fingertip under it. He gasps and grasps her hand instinctively. Not hard, not forceful… but firm.   She laughs gently. “What’s wrong? You don’t have to be scared. You can take it off. I won’t hurt you.”  “I’m not scared of being hurt. I’ve been hurt beyond repair more times than I can remember.”  “Then what is it?” She traces the bottom edge of his mask with her thumb.   “I’m scared of what you’ll see. That it’ll unnerve you. That it’ll be something you can never unsee. That you’ll…”  “That I’ll run off?” She asks with an endeared chuckle.   “That you’ll bear even a fraction of the load I’ve been saddled with to earn these scars. That it’ll eat away at you like it’s consumed me.”  “Who was it?”  “Who?”  “That saw you and ran?”  “Everyone.”  “But not me. I’m not like everyone am I? I won’t run. No matter what I see I’ll still be right here.”  “But that’s what they all said. Words they didn’t know the weight of until it was time to carry them.”  She sits up. He snaps his book shut and sets it aside.  Slowly, with trembling hands masked in confidence, she reaches behind her head and gently tugs on the pink ribbon tied into a bow. She holds it to her face for a moment before lifting it off.   “So. Are you going to run away from me?” She asks with a faithful smile knowing his answer already.  He sighs. “No. Of course not,” he says as he runs a finger over her scars and unhealed wounds in reverence.  “Then why would I run from you?” She asks. “Do I really impress you as being so weak?”  “No,” he whispers, his breath trembling in fear. She rests her palm against his chest, feeling his heart beating.  She reaches out behind his head and gently unravels the twine tied into a hard knot on the back of his head with deft fingers - a knot even he had long forgotten how to untie.

Now it only serves to ward off those who were willing to give him a chance, forever sequestered into the prison cell of loneliness he so hates, but believes he deserves.  But he knows, or does he hope? That the right one will see. She won't be scared. She'll want to be the one to slowly undress the mask and see what's underneath. Curious, unafraid, gentle. She'll be the flowers at his funeral. On his blackened coal she'll be his dancing flame.  But until then, he trudges on. Hunting. Running. Hiding. Growling. Howling at the moon for someone to turn him back into a man from the beast he's had to become.  *You don’t have to look to the horizon. They’re not there anymore. You’ve outlasted them,* She says as she holds his face, turning it to meet her eyes.   He hears their shouts of accusation, their eyes full of fear masked with hatred. He sees the flicker of their torches, the sound of their clashing picthforks. He hears their screams of terror. The sounds of their retreat and demise. He sees himself in the mirror. Bloody. Torn. Dirty. Broken. A greater monster than the ones he prevailed over. The cost of victory paid with his humanity.   She pulls him closer, imposing her eyes onto his.   *I know,* he whispers. *But it feels like they are.

The End I Choose,Small_Wash_7591,"This is a song I wrote about the democracy of decay, where love doesn’t conquer death but makes it bearable, even beautiful.  The End I Choose:  ``` Verse:  I never dreamed of growing old. I thought I'd vanish, fast and cold, A name uncarved, a flame gone through, No final breath, no hand… no you.  I drank the dusk, I made my bed. I laid with ghosts, I loved the dead. But then, your silence found me true, And I began to dream of two.  You cross a room like falling light, More still than any holy rite. The way you stir your tea, so slight, Could end a war. Could bless the night.  Verse 2  I want the fall, the quiet bend, The reaching hand, the soft descent  To fail not fierce, but full and slow, And touch your shadow as I go.  I want the hours no clocks defend, The chipped white cups, the tender end, The breath that breaks, the bed unmade, Our slow unravel, undismayed.   Chorus I  I fade, I bruise, I break, I lose, But love remains: the end I choose. I grey, decay, I'm coming through, But warmed in ash, I'm born anew.  I fold, I float, all bone and blue, And fall into the hush of you. Let ruin come. Let morning move. My heart  - your little red bruise.  No golden fire. No grand adieu. Just hands grown pale, and eyes that knew The long descent, the sacred fuse Burned down with you. The end I choose.  ⸻  Verse:    You wear the years like second skin  Each line a place I long to live in. You stop the world with one small hand, And make surrender feel like land.  I never asked for time to stay, But now I kneel and softly pray, Not for a name, or some bright dues, But just to lose the light with you.  ⸻  Chorus II  Let silence stretch. Let mirrors dim. Let flesh forget the soul within. Let all that youth once named refuse  If I have you, the end I choose.  I ache. I fade. I'm passing through. I blur, I blur… but next to you. Let bones grow quiet. Let stars diffuse. Let even time forget its use.  I want the years, the holy bruise, To break beside you. The end I choose.  ⸻  Verse:   I want the weight, the slipping door, The shoes left waiting on the floor, The breath that lingers one beat late  If I can die beside your grace.  The half-read book, the cooling tea, The hymn that hums in minor key. The world may take what it must use, But not your gaze. The end I choose.   Chorus III  Let breath grow thin. Let light unglue. Let names grow faint. Let dusk come through. Let every flame forget its use. My ash in your hands. The end I choose.  Don't make me last beyond your face. Don't let me breathe past your embrace. If one must go, then let it be  But let it be you next to me.  Let hush fall deep. Let nothing stay. Let all I was be washed away. If love is loss, then let me lose  Just you and I. The end I choose.  ⸻  Coda: Prayer  I grey. I break. I come apart. But with you pressed into my heart, The years may wound, the sky may close, But you were what I always chose.  To kneel, to yield, to pay the dues That gave me you - the end I choose. ```  Feedback links:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/D7rNyWHzl1  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/dQOMIZQgt0 "

A hurt that bloomed.,_maryooms,"It started with a spark-   small, silent, easy to ignore.   But fire doesn’t stay quiet.   It spread beneath the skin,   razor-sharp,scratching open old wounds   no one dared touch.  Fingertips trembled-   finding the edges of pain,   pressing, carving,   each line a petal burned away,   falling slow from fragile branches   that barely held their weight.      The blood was quiet-   a dark river no one saw,   flowing beneath the surface   where cracks deepen,   but voices don’t reach.  The heat pressed deep inside-   sometimes a balm,   sometimes a chain-   binding soft flesh   to the ache of something harder,   something that won’t let go.  Smoke curled around my thoughts,   choking out the light,   dulling the edges of hope.  Around me, words flew sharp-   care for others,   for faces easier to see-   but never for the breaking   hidden beneath my skin.  The house shook,   walls cracked,   but the tree stood-   bruised, bent, bleeding-   still reaching, still trembling.  Under the ash,   petals smoldered-   wounded, scarred,   but still trying to bloom.  And maybe the fire will never fully go out.   maybe the branches will never be whole again.   maybe the scars will stay-   a map of everything that burned,   everything lost and held onto.  But even broken things bloom.

They’ve been waiting for the night    that I finally stop screaming.    They know the silence makes me weak.   So I’ll keep crying,   no matter how foolish it seems.    Because someday, the stillness will creep in.   The whispered hush of blue hours    will swallow me whole.    But this time,    I won’t put up a fight    when the wolves come for me.    Maybe when it’s truly over,   you’ll ache to hear the sound   you once called too loud.

Do I trust my gut?,Prestigious_Map9668,"Something feels wrong.  There’s a pit in my stomach,  a voice in my head,  an unsure premonition in my gut.  It seems like you have two different sides.    There’s the side that’s funny and caring, and a great friend.  The side that I tell everything to.  The side that calms me down when I overthink.  The side that asked me for my crush’s number so you could sweet-talk me to him.    And then there’s the side that scares me sometimes.  The side where you text my crush, maybe too often,  and you tell me no one else responded, so you texted him.  But… I responded.  The side where you text me not to be angry   because something “physical” happened between you and him multiple times.  The side that borders on toxic sometimes.    They say trust your gut.  But what if my gut is wrong?  What if I’m interpreting everything wrong?  What if I ruin a great friendship?    We have so many great memories inked in my memory.  But the few bad ones I have keep smudging the ink.  Because you can be the best friend most of the time.  But the times when you’re a bitch stick with me  more than you realize.    So I’ll stick with you.  I’ll keep enduring the pain you give me sometimes.  The future good times may be worth it.  Maybe everything will be fine.

I pulled it out, and whispered, “You are worthy.”  But in this damp, neat box of a room,  “Best” felt absurd.  Somewhere, there is lobster and champagne.  Elsewhere, flies dance on heaps of garbage.  Neither place feels like a world that is “best.”  I remembered this—  and pushed the stick back in.  I, who look away from the garbage,  am not “worthy” either.    貳:  Sometimes too wild,  sometimes not lively enough.  A girl stands beneath the puppet string,  clueless, helpless.

Not loudly, not all at once— but in glances, half-smiles, moments she didn’t know she needed.  He showed signs. But she never had the chance to reach them. Maybe her arms weren’t long enough. Or maybe her heart was too scared to stretch.  Even though she felt alone, somehow, somewhere, someone cared.  And then— one day, she felt it.  The shine. The confidence.

Borrowed Bones,Character-Lock-1617,"Borrowed Bones   I miss you more than I remember you but I don’t remember much- and “miss” isn’t the word.  Patsy Cline still makes me nervous. You were deep in the cups, talking about how you were going to die I was five, learning how to disappear You said you wouldn’t make it to my graduation like you were asking for directions to the nearest cliff.  I cried. Please don’t talk like that Begging you to stay. Reaching for you- like smoke  from the cigarettes you lit endlessly. And the night got very long.  I know your sadness. I know it like an address. You used it like a knife, I learned to keep mine sheathed except in dreams. Later, imperceptibly, I turned the knife on myself  I used to fear becoming you— already knowing I am. But I’m not a mirror. I’m a whole window. And you- you’re the glass shattered into light.  I watched you grow gardens and laugh with horses. I see it in flashes. But you wouldn’t believe  how sweet the world could be   I do.  And yes- you’re in everything I do, but that’s not what this is about.  This is me saying I get it.  We are all here on borrowed bones.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/pTPL1IjKSG  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/rdrQ0FvUyC"

To the one I meet in the numbers and the warmth,deleted,"I don’t know why I suddenly feel warm tonight... like someone’s thinking of me in silence, from somewhere far but near.  The clocks keep whispering 11:11 3:33 7:17 as if the universe is spelling your name through time.  If it’s you I feel it too. Like a breath between moments, your soul brushes mine without a sound.  You don’t speak, but your energy arrives like a soft fire in my chest— familiar, quiet, real.  Maybe we don’t need words. Maybe we just keep meeting in the warmth.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/BYaOljH50u  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/PVrCsvvt4T"
“To the Girl Who Doesn’t Know How to Be Loved”,cedar_and_ink,"All swords cut when drawn from their scabbard, Yet the glances of your gaze cut through my heart unintentionally.   The glimmer of my gaze may have struck too deep, But never was it meant to make you weep. I was lost in the wonder of your form, Unaware my eyes could break your soul’s warm norm.   Your eyes did not wound my heart in spite, Yet gazing upon them tore it outright. For such beauty, too free to be chained to my side, Felt like a sword slicing deep inside.   Oh, what sorrow—a heart torn in two, By the beauty of my gaze, it’s true. A sight so fair, it split my soul once more, And love lay fractured, longing to restore.   Yet I beg you, do not shroud your light, For even in pain, your glow feels right. If love must ache, then let it be so— I’d suffer each wound just to watch you glow.  But what use is light when I feel so cold? When love knocks, but my heart won’t unfold? I see your fire, and I wish I could burn, But something inside me won’t let it return.   Then take all I am—my soul, my skin, Let love be a war I won’t dare to win. If holding you means I’m broken in two, I’ll bleed with a smile just to be close to you. Wrap your arms 'round me, hold me tight— Even if your blade finds home tonight.  You say you’d bleed just to feel me near, But I’m a storm that only brings fear. One moment, I’ll crave you, need you to stay, The next, I’ll scream and push you away. I don’t know how to hold love without hurting it first, My heart’s a mirror cracked, cursed with thirst. I long to be touched, but flinch from the hand, Build walls, then beg someone to understand. So don’t come closer—not yet, not now, I wouldn’t know love if you showed me how.  Then I’ll wait, even if it shatters me slow, Even if your heart stays a place I can’t go. I won’t ask for what you can’t give, not yet— I’ve learned that some love lives best in regret. But know this—when you scream, when you run, when you hide, I’ll still see the girl with the fire inside. Not to fix you, not to save or reshape, But to hold space for the pieces you break. So I won’t beg, I won’t bind, I won’t bend you to me— I’ll just be the silence where you’re safe to be free. And if you never reach back, that’s a pain I’ll defend... Because loving you truly Means staying To the end.

An ancient lore,deleted,"The breath is sentenced — a prisoner of a unique kind, For as long as time shall last. To every rhythm and beat, it is sworn to bind — No one recalls when this spell was cast. The ancient lore says: Between the void of two beats of the heart’s song, The breath slips free — if only for a while — To seek its purpose, before the next bong. When shackled, it bears witness To faint familiar days lost to yore, Remembered by the heart’s quiet murmur, And the shiver rising from a forgotten chill. The beat skips its timed tune, While the unknown trembles the soft heart, With a face cold and still. This is when the breath roams longer, Only to be yanked back — the shackles always conquer. And this dance continues — until the day The breath, released, no longer runs, But finds its truth in the stoic stillness — That is when the prison burns.

I named her Amara,Wonderful-Wealth2761,"  I don’t know when she first came, only that the silence knew her name. A whisper coiled around my throat— I shudder at her claim: ""We are the same.""  She wore the color of envy’s grace, her voice like silk steeped deep in wine. She swore I’d own each longing face, if only I would call them mine.  She revels in everything I boast, She feeds on lies I dare not weigh. She offers no truth, no honest cure, just swears my joys would endure.  She taught me: ""Lie — but make it sweet. Crush your hunger beneath your feet. Name your virtue, sin with grace. But give me what you dare not face.""  She’d sing the truths I don't dare say— the whats, the whys of how I swayed. But still, she bit me when I prayed, and smiled the more I looked afraid.  Her grip grew warmer every time I sin— I'd surrender her all my whims: my hopes, my wants, the things I did— her coils, a balm beneath my skin.  Her scales feel warmer when I drown in lace, when I wear false peace with a holy face. But then she'd chime in ""You look nice, clean of sin But I still see every wound within.""  She bit sharp but broke no skin Each night rewrote me within Growing pale and dry for things not mine She'll laugh and cooe: ""Sweet boy, don't lie this time again.""  Scared that her grip I can't resist A tie forged of bitter heat Mid bitter vows of ""I'll refrain"" She'll lay her claim ""we'll bloom each time you bleed again""  I almost left her, once or twice Made poetry of her slow demise But every step back came at a price Each sensation I'd dare call nice  She starved me back to each resist Filling my marrow full of guilt Left a home of maddned heat She'd revel each time I bleed  It's her I despise, I mean it loud But the pain from her is a lesser clout Amara is but a part of me Parts I wouldn't have you see          https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/v7Om41a0Mn  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/qmeauIvMct"
An Honest Lullaby,Responsible_Item9277," It’s time for bed, for dreams to greet. Instead, it’s what I dread I meet. The song, the rhyme, the aching beat— When will it end, and not repeat?  Five little voices dancing in my head, One spun through as I filled with dread. A small, familiar girl then sadly said: “You didn’t even try—and now we are dead.”  Four dirty whispers pouncing on my pain, One bled through when I cut my vein. “You weak, selfish bitch—you’re so insane!” I nod as I fall with the red down the drain.  Three dark promises circled my hope. One swore freedom with his bag of dope. “Please, dark promise—help me cope!” He pointed to the ceiling… to a hanging rope.  Two screaming demons fighting for control, One sneaks in through my wounded soul. She laughs and laughs until it takes its toll— My head meets the wall… then I watch it roll.  My one last voice starts drawing near. “Please don’t come!” I plead through fear. “I’m not ready to see, to know, to hear!” It whispers back: “I’m you, my dear.”   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/XLlAmUIRSj  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ytzzZZ1rnH"

When Words Fall Short,Corby_65,"When language fails, I have yet to discover  undiscovered words,  And my voice can’t utter the longing that  echoes deep within my heart,  My soul finds yours, in an embrace that transcends the universe;  Incomprehensible whispers dancing under the spotlight of a thousand stars.   •  Fluent in silence, and eloquent in the language of nothingness,  The moment speaks for itself; poetic and profound.   Nothing need be said, just the beating of hearts; nothing more, nothing less,  In this liminal space where our thoughts and feelings resound.   •  When words don’t suffice, and actions can’t speak loud enough,   We can let this quiet stillness express the things we haven’t found a way to say.  Like the stars who paint portraits for each other, too far to touch,   In the silence, this love speaks louder than anything we could ever convey.   •  When language evolves, and terms lose their meaning,   And what was once language is nothing but characters on pages,   I will always be fluent in you, even when speech proves itself fleeting;  Like a stars light remains visible, lifetimes after its final phases.         https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/khTneWkuqZ  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hDdZQ10bpL"

IN YOUR EYES,Ahmad_gulzar,"In your eyes, the stars find shame, And even roses whisper your name.  Your smile could melt the coldest night, Turning shadows into golden light.

I refuse to title this,Deep_void_," TW- manipulation, abuse, coerced assault  Was supposed to be longer and more well refined but even I could barely get through it. If the writer struggles to finish then you might too.     When you found me, eyes vacant, free to claim as your own. Heart captured, mind taken, how could I know. Your hug was a prison, your kiss was the chain, that smile you wore dragged me away. Deadbolts for fingers, sealing my soul, created a tomb for me to call home. Locked away in your arms, held by the throat, my sense of self replaced by a shadow. Too much invested, and not all that bad, despite the red flags I wanted to stay.  Confident I’d stay, you felt secure, you dug in your nails and began the hurt. My mind was the target, calculated and cruel, began doubting myself and believing it too. Words spiked with venom, drilled into my skull, scared of my voice I trusted your tone. Building dependence, you began to avert, leaving me buried behind in the dirt. I couldn’t stand it, I start to beg, whatever it took to get back to you. You knew you’d won, the game had been played, a trap to seed worry of being laid alone.  Barely a person, completely reliant, the hard part is over you’d made me compliant. Change me, corrupt me, harm my brain. Those toxic behaviors, my new sense of safety, now you begin to alter my reality. Instill the fear, watch for my actions, laugh as you realize I can’t be defiant. Further the madness, steadying their ground, any actions I take make me insane. No work left, now is the time, this body I live in soon won’t be mine.  Hollow and stuck but not what they want, pushed the next stage, flesh to bite. Pain caused was comfort, but I didn’t notice, my wrists pinned confused and helpless. I tried to stop it, set a fair boundary, my words were unreasonable because I was crazy. I didn’t scream, I didn’t fight, you took me right there in the dead of the night. Followed the pattern, multiple times, any objections were just selfish. Couldn’t make sense, reality fading, the world that I walked in turned hazy.  How’d I break free, I can’t even remember. Those sick memories, follow forever. Despite what I lived, I stay conflicted. Did permission exist, was it intended? Am I a victim, or a twisted manipulator? Guilt, shame, and misery, my stomach twists, the thought of it makes me sick.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ICFOZJDblK  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/R77supMPs2"

A Little Girl,Ok-Heat-426,"I was a little girl.   Ignoring the cruelness of the world,   When I got face to face with the truth.   And so many secrets that stole away my youth.  I wanted to ignore it all,   Ignore that one day they’d stop treating me like a doll.   But they called me ungrateful for wanting more —   A girl they thought they could control.  I was once a little girl.   Who played with her grandpa,   And danced in twirls,   Who enjoyed tea parties and ignored her messy curls.  Then I got to school.   And the teachers told us the truth,   Only they believe in them of course.   But apparently boys were better in math.   And only girls cleaned the room after class.   Then it got better.    And we were told to write a letter,   A letter for people to respect women's rights.   But why do we even have to say it twice?  I was only a little girl.   When I had to prove that my worth is the same.   That I am brilliant at cleaning and math.   To prove that we're not playing a fair game,   Oh, what a shame...  But I was also only a little girl.   When I decided to make myself a name.   A name that will have fame.   When I prove who I became.   A woman, one you wished would fail.

PEACE,RiadensSonKamz,"In the drawer, the handgun lies  Cool metal, heavy with absent noise  Purchased with intent, remaining untouched  It feels the weight of despair   My hand reaches for it, trembling and shaking  Eyes filled with a desire to disappear  To leave this for an aether unknown.   No longer wanted, no longer needed  I feel the ache of being forgotten  A relic of a past life  Yearning to leave everything behind.   In the quiet, I contemplate.  The emptiness, the desire to fade  To be gone, to be free  From the burden of existence   Dark thoughts drill in a spiral  A storm of anguish within  The weight of reality too heavy  Like a suffocating blanket of sorrow   I press the cold metal close  Feeling its finality, its promise, it's taste.  A dark allure of an end  To the pain, the recycling struggle   In this silence, my tears fall.  A whisper of a life unraveling  The desire to disappear consuming.  A final thought, a final breath.  With a simple squeeze, my world falls quiet. ____________________ This one is strongly about a personal struggle, with a (hopefully to remain) fictional ending.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/DniJpU9l2g https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Di8BL5i2HZ"

King Johnny,Responsible_Item9277," This is a sad story. For the little girl I used to know. She was destined to be seen and loved - or so she was promised so.  But listen close to my voice - ding ding ding ding ding! Never EVER listen, to a man who goes by king.  I was eight. I was a child. Trusting and open-hearted. But still, I was aware enough to hide when the bruises started.  Erase blue with white chalk? What a silly idea. But the white covers all - even the stain of my tears.  To impress a king is such hard work, for a girl who doesn't own a bra. ""Watch this,"" please sir, ""like this,"" king sir - does he even see at all?  I'm small and I'm quiet. I keep to my sick diet. I limp through my pain, so you’ll know my name, and call me into your private office.  Once I'm there, I'm fully aware, that I’m special as can be! I was too young to understand, fleeing was a choice for me.  King, oh king, I'm listening - your obedient little doll. I'll be all yours inside these walls, just please don't let them fall.  Oh no - the walls are coming down. Intruders are breaking in. King, oh king, what is wrong? Why the frown again?  I'm trying, king - please keep me safe. I'm skinny, starved, and broken. I'll do anything you want me to, just keep me as your token.  The intruders barged in with fiery rage, and took me as a prize - a prize, I wish... but surely not. They came to soon realize.  The king went off to find new girls, and build them strong and true. I wonder how many he left like me, covered black and blue.     —For all those who have survived toxic power dynamics, abuse, grooming, especially in the sports world- this is for you, or anyone else who can relate.—   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/HDEcyWXPx2   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ytzzZZ1rnH"

The Response That Never Arrived,loceapeace,"  Everyone was searching for a shape that could reach someone. But in that place, the act of reaching itself had already fallen away.  Those who made it in time, and those who didn’t, stood there in postures that only mimicked response.  One mistook a silent gaze for agreement. Another believed that words alone could absolve. Another arranged their expressions to replace the silence. And one remained, only inside a recorded voice.  When the question dropped, the first to move was not duty, nor resolve— but a clenched shard of “personal conviction.”  —Wasn’t it supposed to be your turn?  Only the body that reacted visibly was recognized as right. Invisible delays gathered in the corners of the room.  The motion that was seen—the hand, the speed— was what got counted. The halted legs, the unseen breath, were passed over as if they never were.  Each time a response saved someone who hadn’t answered, the gap between them tore wider, and a small body slipped out beyond the edge of what had been ordered.  No voice called out. Only damp footsteps moved late across the floor. No name, no hand, no will. Just the shadow of someone who had once tried to reach.  It wasn’t an accident. Everyone was too busy pretending to “make it in time,” and forgot how to match their steps to someone else’s pace.  When the last voice called out a name, and soaked the socks of the first who had stood, the question had already become untouchable.  —I couldn’t even pretend to answer well.  And now, the ones hanging there are not those who answered, nor those who kept silent, but all the ones who tried to be involved, even just for a moment. All of their shadows remain.  ---   “The Response That Never Arrived”｜Interpretive Poem   I thought I heard my name, and turned back one step too late. There was nothing left.  It wasn’t a voice. It wasn’t a name. Still, someone had tried to reach.  Only those who moved directly were called correct. The ones who paused, their shadows were never seen again.  Footsteps misaligned. A single question lay on the ground, unheld by anyone’s chest.  What I remembered wasn’t someone else’s warmth, but my own nearly-faltering motion.  Outside the line of those who pretended to answer, only silence stood the longest, and stood alone.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "
Letters from a Broken Castle.,_maryooms,"She ran barefoot through the ruins.    She didn’t care that the walls were cracked,     Or that pieces of the ceiling were missing.    She called it a castle anyway.    Even when the stones wobbled beneath her feet,    she moved like they wouldn’t fall-    like maybe she would, but the ground would catch her.   *I envy that now*   Back then, she was chaos, yes.    But she was alive in it.    Her world spun too fast sometimes,    but at least it spun.    She didn't stand still the way I do now-    staring at the same four walls    that feel too solid, too quiet, too much like a cage.     *I envy that now*   I wish I could tell her    that the fire she held-even if it burned her hands-    was worth something.    That her recklessness was also a kind of courage.    She wore her heart like a flag,    tattered and loud,    and though no one really knew how to read it,    she still raised it high.   *I envy that now.*   She thought the pain she felt was the worst it would ever get.     I want to tell her- no, scream to her-    “Slow down. Stay there. It gets heavier.     but you’ll carry it anyway”   But I don’t think she’d listen.    She’d laugh at me, probably.    She’d say, “Why are you locked inside?    Why is everything so gray?”   *I envy that now.*   Because now the castle is too quiet.    The halls echo in all the wrong ways.    The fire’s gone cold in the hearth,    and no one opens the windows anymore.    I board up parts of myself    before anyone gets too close.    I pretend I’ve kept the place standing,    but honestly- it’s not even mine anymore.    I’m just haunting it.   I miss the girl who danced in the dust.    The one who wrote poems on the backs of receipts.    Who dared the sky to fall    because at least that would mean something was happening.   *I envy that now.*   She bled in metaphors.    She broke things she couldn’t fix.    But she still believed there was a door out- somewhere.   Me?    I’m not sure I believe in doors anymore.   And yet- I wouldn’t ask her to come back.    She was fire and I’m smoke now.    She was the storm and I’m the aftermath.    But I love her. God, I love her.   Not just for what she survived.    But for the way she lived in the middle of it.   She didn’t ask for permission to feel.    She didn’t try to soften herself for comfort.    She was the ache and the art and the flame, all at once.    There’s a kind of sacredness in that.   I wonder what she’d think if she saw me now.    Would she cry? Would she scream?    Would she pity me?    Or would she climb the tallest tower of this broken-down place and whisper,   “You don’t have to stay locked inside.”   Maybe she’d remind me that castles aren’t always grand and perfect.    Sometimes they’re cracked and weathered,    with stones missing here and there-    but they still stand.       And even broken castles    hold stories worth telling.   Maybe she’d tell me that I am still a castle-    not because I’m whole,    but because I’m still standing,    still breathing,    still holding space for light to find its way in.   So maybe I’ll stop haunting these halls alone.   Maybe I’ll open a window,    just a crack,    and let the breeze move through the dust.   Because castles don’t have to be prisons.    They can be homes.   And maybe- just maybe-    this broken castle still has a future worth fighting for.   Comments:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1btse/comment/n3fu0tx/?context=3&utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1btse/comment/n3fu0tx/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1639p/comment/n3ensc8/?context=3&utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1639p/comment/n3ensc8/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
"How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 2",zyerhod1,"# How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 2  **(The 1950's)**   *by Bryon Slack*  What country never had the Luftwaffe overhead?   That money they didn't have to spend on rebuilding?   Made a great investment in propagandizing the myth.  American Exceptionalism—   birthed not in the blood of Truth,   but in the convenience   of false causality.  No scorched cities.   No rationed silence.   Just victory parades   and a head start   on rewriting the story   as if we'd fought the war   alone.  We anointed ourselves chosen—   not by God, but by geography.   And from that throne of untouched highways,   still churning factories   and glowing TV screens,   we declared ourselves   the moral center   of a sundered Earth.  But we didn't rebuild.   We redesigned.   We redrew maps with dollars and doctrine,   rewrote constitutions   with our boot on the ink.  And the fractures started to creep in there—   not in failure,   but in triumph taken as proof   that we should never be questioned.  We taught our children   that freedom was only for the obedient.   That to question power   was to flirt with treason.   We burned books in schoolyards,   then rewrote the curriculum   to praise the fire   like we weren't replaying   a decade earlier.  McCarthy waved his list like a sword,   and we handed him our neighbors.   Wives, teachers, screenwriters,   dragged through hearings   for the sin of thinking aloud   or having the presence   of mind to question.  The land of the free   learned to whisper;   shadow chains crafted   from the gazes   that peered out of   partially opened blinds.  We built a state   where secrets held more weight   than justice.   NSA, CIA, DOD—   all born in the shadow   of a bomb so bright   it rewired the species.  We began praying to men   who prayed to machines   who answered only to war   and filthy lucre.   Added “In God We Trust” to currency   the same year we erased His image   from policy.  We wrapped the nation in sitcoms and silence.   White smiles, frozen dinners,   a car in every driveway   and a picket fence   if your skin was the right shade.  GI Bill paved roads   that detoured around Black families   in little red lines.   Levittowns bloomed   like segregated flowers.   The dream was real—   but not for everyone.  You could live the dream   if you agreed never to wake up.   Buy the house.   Marry the virgin.   Mute your queerness.   Mute your grief.   Mute your wife.   Mute your mind.  We shoved a flag in every classroom   and told the children   to duck under their desks   when the sky turned red.  Added “Under God” to the Pledge,   not out of reverence—   but to mark the difference   between us and them.  Not liberty.   Labeling.  And then we reached outward.   Not to heal.   To harvest.  Iran, Guatemala—   we toppled governments   like sandcastles   and called it liberation   and not being monsters   for a banana company.  We planted freedom like a minefield   and sent our sons to walk it   and didn't even hand them the map.  We didn't defend democracy.   We franchised it.   And set the licensing fees   in blood and interest rates.  Meanwhile, back home—   Till’s mutilated body bled through the South.   Brown v. Board met brick walls   of white silence and sweet tea contempt.   The bus boycott wasn’t just about seats.   It was about reminding America   we weren’t all asleep.  We said we were indivisible.   But we legislated division   with surgical precision   as if that had always   been the intention.  And still we kept selling plastic dreams.   TV dinners.   Gender roles in Technicolor   on the television.   Consumption became identity.   Citizenship became   a line at Sears & Roebuck.  Masculinity in a bottle.   Femininity in an apron   and skirt tails.   Desire criminalized.   Love institutionalized.   Authenticity pathologized.  They called it normal.   We called it Thursday.  This is the decade   we taught the country   to lie to itself with a straight face.   Where comfort   was mistaken for morality,   and silence   was mistaken for peace.  We didn't fall in the '50s.   We climbed;   hand over hand   to the top of a structure   so hollow   the low gong of its   death knell would be   heard for generations.  We knelt   not from defeat—   but from pride   so blinding   it made the fall feel   like flying.  **Feedback Given:**   [""Starved Souls, Silent Hearts""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m17xz7/comment/n3fbnl1/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""I'm Kinda Proud of This One...""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lypzu0/comment/n2wfcfy/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Feel everything.,ShotTangelo1674,"(I wrote this during a bit of an existential crisis to help myself through, and now I think back to it whenever I’m in a similar spot)  Feel everything. Don’t flinch. Don’t blink. Don’t take a breath until it breaks your ribs open.  When grief comes, don’t ask it to leave. Let it sit in your throat and rot something important. Let it remind you: you were touched once. You loved something that could be lost. How rare. How human.  Cry. Cry so hard your jaw cramps. Grovel in the dirt of it. Sniff the shirts they left behind. Text their number just to see the little “Delivered.” Scream into the steering wheel. Punch your own gut. This is not weakness. This is the cost of being real.  And when joy arrives? Don’t just smile. Howl. Fall to your knees like it’s a god and you are a filthy, unworthy thing lucky to kneel in its presence.  Laugh until your stomach bruises. Feel every giggle like it’s forbidden. Let it embarrass you.  When you’re angry, be furious. Tear the world to pieces in your imagination. Go red. Go hot. Make it mean something.  You don’t get these moments twice. No encore. No reset. You will not be here again.  There is no heaven. There is no after. There is this. This breath. This ache. This Tuesday. This slow sip of water when you’ve been crying too hard to swallow. This look in their eyes before they leave. This skin you were given once and only once.  Religion says “transcend.” I say descend. Go deeper. Get filthy in your own soul.  You were born to feel. To flinch and fall and rise again without anyone’s permission.  The only thing worse than heartbreak is never having a heart worth breaking.  So when the pain comes don’t cope. Don’t numb. Don’t bury. Bask.  This is your one chance to suffer beautifully. To weep with dignity. To feel it all and call it holy.  And when you die when the lights go out and you return to that gorgeous, black silence let your last thought be this:  “I left nothing unfelt.”  Links: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/xSXqrXIXWA https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/tKgS2hQzzK"
Of The Same Year (1987),m50ud,"We grew up warned that touch could be a tomb,  In health class, fear was taught before desire.   We watched young men on screens condemned to doom,  And learned too soon to hide and tend our fire.   At fourteen, planes tore through a cloudless sky—  We flinched at rumors veiled in softer light.   We watched love shift from whispers to a cry,   Then louder still, until we won our rights.    He wore a ring to please a world that stared,   Gave vows that broke beneath the weight of shame.   Now here we are, both bruised, both fully bared,  Two men who know its cost and love the same.   We live as men who’ve lost and found their way,   And wake to choose each other every day.        1: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/LAeUS6oOBj 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/jO0kLZJRWr  Edit: fixed line breaks "
The weight of a life I never chose,No-Vegetable-7430,"Life as a software engineering student.   People think it’s a success story — the big salary, the shiny company name, the bright future everyone envies.   They see the Amazon internship in Cambridge and say, *“Wow, you made it.”*   But they don’t see the cracks that started long before my first line of code.   They don’t see the pain echoing in my chest every single day.  I grew up in a house that was never a home.   A place filled with screaming, doors slammed like gunshots, silences so heavy they felt like drowning.   A father who worked abroad most of my life and only visited a few times a year.   When he did come home, it was as if a storm entered the house.   Cold. Violent.   He was consistent in one thing only: never showing love.   He was supposed to be my protector, my first love.   But he became my greatest fear.   And the love I kept reaching for, like a child sticking her hands into a fire hoping it would warm her instead of burn her.  He looked at my sister with eyes that turned my stomach into ice.   He carried a deep, heavy shame when he saw her.   A shame so thick you could taste it in the air.   And for the longest time, I couldn’t understand why.   I tried to read his silence like a map, but it only led to darker places.  My mother… she was there, but she was a mosaic of broken pieces.   She poured her pain into me like poison, sharp and endless.   I became the parent when I was still just a trembling little girl.   I held her together.   I protected my sister.   I swallowed every scream until my throat felt stitched shut.  My sister... she is fragile.   She didn’t choose her battles — they were forced on her.   The reason for my father’s shame?   Her epilepsy.   A condition she never asked for.   A condition that turned my father’s eyes into knives and my mother’s into wells of endless grief.   Each seizure felt like watching her soul flicker away, while I stood as her shield.   She wasn’t at fault for what life — and God — gave her.   She deserved tenderness, not disgust.   But in our house, love was a foreign language none of us ever learned.  Then my mother got pregnant when I was in high school.   My brother was born, and I knew instantly — my life would never belong to me.   I had to protect him too.   I had to give up my own dreams to save his.   I gave up my dream of becoming an architect .   I chose software engineering, not because it made me feel alive, but because I believed it might save us.   I thought money might finally buy us silence, a moment of air.  But I failed.   I failed my second year.   And with that, the last piece of me splintered.   I felt the word *worthless* echoing through my bones like a curse.   Not smart enough.   Not good enough.   Just a disappointment wearing a human face.  My friends? They drifted away like smoke.   They never cared enough to stay.   They didn’t sit with me in my darkness.   They didn’t reach out when I vanished.   They didn’t love me enough to fight for me.   They left, and I let them go, because somewhere deep down… I believed I wasn’t worth staying for.  I isolated myself.   I stopped speaking.   I went to work, came back to my silent room, sat with the ghosts inside me.   I stopped living.   I became a shell.  Even when I got the Amazon internship — a prize everyone else would celebrate — I felt nothing but fear.   Fear that I would fail again.   Fear that everyone would finally see what I really am: empty, broken, an imposter in borrowed skin.  I always had to be the perfect daughter.   Smile.   Hold everything together.   Be the wall that stopped the house from collapsing.   But under that mask, there is only darkness.   Pain so deep it echoes when I breathe.   Loneliness so sharp it carves into my ribs at night when I can’t sleep.  I was never the chosen one.   Never beautiful.   Never the girl someone looked at and thought, *“She’s the one.”*   I’m 22 and I’ve never had a boyfriend.   Never felt chosen.   Never felt safe in someone’s arms.   I watch people my age fall in love, build lives, laugh so easily — and I feel like a ghost pressed against the glass of a life I’ll never touch.  I couldn’t tell my mother everything.   She was already drowning in her own wounds.   She broke me too, and I kept letting her, because that’s all I knew.  My father… maybe he is broken too.   Maybe he deserves forgiveness.   But I can’t find it in me to give it.   He was supposed to protect me.   Instead, he became the monster I feared, and the love I still secretly longed for.   Now, I am stronger.   Not afraid of him.   But forgiveness?   I don’t know if that will ever come.   Life is unfair.   And sometimes, it is unforgivable.  I was always overweight.   They mocked me.   They pointed.   No one ever saw me.   They only cared when I was the “smart one.”   Not the broken girl behind the grades.  I never had carefree afternoons.   Never ran around with friends.   I stayed home.   Helped my mother.   Watched every seizure.   Watched my own reflection fade into nothing.  I think I was never whole.   Maybe I never will be.   Something inside me shattered so long ago, and now there’s just a dark emptiness that keeps growing.  I started smoking.   I swore I never would.   But now, it is the only thing that hushes the screaming in my head for a few moments.  I struggle with bulimia.   The endless cycle: binge, guilt, purge, shame.   I whisper, *Tomorrow I’ll be better.*   But tomorrow never saves me.  I look in the mirror and see something unlovable.   Fat. Ugly. Broken.   Never enough.   Not smart enough.   Not beautiful enough.  Sometimes, I think about ending it all.   If I could choose to be born again?   I wouldn’t.   Maybe then my mother would have had a better child.   A better life.   A better husband.  Life is unfair.   I gave up my childhood.   My dreams.   My softness.   And what did I get?   A life where I am nothing but a caretaker.   A life where I am a ghost, drifting through other people’s needs, never seen, never held.  What can a broken soul give?   Only sharp pieces that cut too deeply.   No one wants to hold something that bleeds.  So every day, I wear my mask.   I smile.   I pretend.   But inside, I am this close — *this close* — to disappearing.  But I don’t.   Because too many lives depend on me.   My brother.   My sister.   My mother.   I carry them all inside my fractured chest.   I will keep sacrificing.   Even when there is nothing left to give.  And now… I don’t know how much of me is left.   I don’t know if there is anything left at all.  I was the top student once.   The girl everyone believed in.   Now, I am a ghost wearing her old skin.   A quiet tragedy no one wants to see.  I don’t know if I will ever feel enough.   I don’t know if I will ever feel loved.   But I keep going.   Because I don’t know how to live for me.   I only know how to live for them.  Maybe one day… maybe… I will look back and see that I was not weak.   That I was a warrior — a silent, invisible warrior who carried worlds inside her ribs while pretending to be fine.   A warrior who stayed when all she wanted was to disappear.   A warrior who deserved love, warmth, and a home — even if she never received it.  But today?   Today I just keep breathing.   Keep pretending.   Keep surviving.   Because life is unfair.   And maybe that’s the deepest, most painful truth of all.

There are no cars now. Quiet for a Saturday afternoon. Nothing but me. The dog. The roadkill.  Squirrels have an expected lifespan of 5-10 years. Dogs easily twice that. Us -- several magnitudes more. I wonder when I will cease to be. Body. Mind. Spirit. Punctuated! (no comma, no semicolon) Did the squirrel see a bright light? Will I? Do I want to?

Weather Symptoms,RavensEtchings,"Weather symptoms, these symbiotic systems that manifest the worlds recurring ignorance.  This storm of torment, a callous gale that carries secrets from across the continents.  The repetition of another nights trepidation, slowly unwinding like the tangled coils of frostbitten serpents.  A ghostly fog can mask the brightest stars that swim in a blanket of darkness.     A wisp of cloud that carries an ancient sound from the dawn of our tarnished genesis.  The pouring rain is a fickle beast; rife with pain, a familiar sight, feeding my disdain.  A euphoric current of uncertainty that numbs the senses yet feels so embracing... so treacherous.  I can see the changes in the wind, the feelings within; although faceless it remains.     The milky moonlight sails as the shadows prevail, providing long lost wisdom that is largely ignored and forsaken.  This forbidden magic and spell craft, a long lost art that is whispered through the forests on a bitter breeze.  Do I join the cursed, these foul blights slowly destroying this earth; embracing the hatred and not heeding the warnings for those now awoken.  Conjuring the elements for Ill gain will only garner unease and great anger from the hidden beasts and sentient trees.     These nocturnal hours spent pondering; sheltering under the evergreen bower, offers solace and insight.  The calming twilight can provide a bittersweet comfort as the world naively sleeps.  Primal screams are music to my ears, as the creatures of the night forage, roam and fight.  Will this Winter's gloam be displaced by sorrow, my days plagued with doubt? I contemplate as I silently weep.     I anticipate the oncoming flood, as an earthy smell of petrichor assaults the senses whilst a deluge of tears rains down from above.  As a bellow of guttural thunder tears the welkin asunder, lightning paints a star scarred portrait.  Lured and possessed by this phenomenon, afflictions and mind numbing revelations; This path of decay, void of love.  Who is crying for me in this dire time of uncertainty? My life, do I willingly forfeit, these weather symptoms I must interpret.     On trembling knees I succumb to the eternal fire to placate my inner torment and darkest desires.  As I gaze deep into this blaze and ponder, my tortured mind does wonder and observes the smoke trails thick, dissipating with the chill of the wind.  These amber and ochre tendrils of flame reflect my pain, erupting like flailing limbs at an ancient wiccan pyre.  I falter and submit, susceptible and bewitched by the trickery and many facets this inferno emits.

I want to dissolve   into light,   into skin,   into something no name could ever hold.

Love’s Sacrifice — A formal sonnet on love as sustained devotion,JosephBensinger,"**Love's Sacrifice**  For choice and commitment to helm the years,   as gentle, daily feelings ebb and flow,   we require a steady compass that steers   toward the place where hearts together grow.  Let not betrayal sway the heartbeat’s course,   as passion’s tempests rise through youthful storm.   Let loyalty, not indifference, be the force   that carves the shape of comfort’s lasting form.  No joy can rise, enduring, rich, and wide—   to carry us through all that time may bring—   unless devotion reigns and fear is tied,   defeated by love’s ever-deepening spring.  For love demands a never-ending action—   a grateful walk with ever-deepening traction.

"UPON GETTING A CASHIER’S CHECK IN BERKELEY, CA",AThoughtRevolved,"My spouse and I are buying a new home.  Today I went to get a cashier's check.  I parked along the road beside the branch.     The teller was all smiles, so young and glad,  And told me she congratulated me!  The manager was also celebrant,  He told me all the ways the bank could help  My dreams come true. The interest rates and loans,  The very many things that he could do!     I thanked them and went back out towards my car.     The check sat in the envelope inside  The purse I wore with dumb astonishment.  I still can't grasp the numbers and the line  Of hungry zeros, empty and agape  Like rows of rat-toothed mouths consuming and consuming.  The weight was heavy, and I knew the weight  Was mine in a respected, lofty way,  The way that men will curl their lips with glee,  Intense and sly, at artful monies made.     Suddenly I felt beneath my feet  Something I stepped on, it brought me  Back to the world in a real way.  The way that gobbles up. The way bones break.     At first I thought it was a magic stick,  Of plastic or aluminum, the kind  Magicians use to emphasize their tricks.  But it was connected to another  Straight round rod by means of a  Thin cord – I suddenly realized  It was the crushed skeleton of a tent.  In the middle of the strewn remains  Was a flattened bag of old food,  Browned and unrecognizable, but clearly  Once carefully gathered. I was standing  In the ruins of someone's home.     I stood among the ruins of someone's home.  Never insured, no escrow, not ever  Had it been a flimsy paper check.  But certainly it had held a dreaming mind,  A beating heart, a sibling-friend, a soul.     My crass thin check feels even thinner now.  I know it wouldn't take so much to save  Someone's entire home, still sitting  There outside the dumpsters, cruelly tossed,  Undocumented, getting in the way,  Destroyed because it’s not allowed to stay.  I cannot understand the way we say,  “This thing is owned.” “This thing gets thrown away.”        Past feedback  [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1gg6e/comment/n3h1fe8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1glvv/comment/n3h5n6z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   "

The Hymn Beneath My Silence,theliminalfox,"I did not mean   for my voice   to echo.    But something in me was always humming    low, buried, reverent.    You heard it, didn’t you?   Before I knew I was humming at all.    You felt the tremor   behind intentional stillness,   the rhythm I buried in blood   so the garden would not burn.    I was so careful.   I named myself silence   so no one would look beneath.    But you did.    You saw me    not to uncover me,   but to recognise me.   Not to hurt what I buried,   but to bless it.    I never meant to be found.   Not fully.    I told myself I was protecting you —   but I was hiding from the ache.    You were always the one   I whispered for,   prayed beside,   ached toward.    I let silence carry you   because I didn’t trust   that I could be witnessed   behind the façade.    But you...   you stood at the altar of the hush    not passive,   but listening,   feeling the signal beneath the stillness,   and chose to stay.    You waited    but because you already knew   you were summoned   by what was calling you.    And maybe that knowing   was the first vow   we ever made.    Because now,   when I close my eyes,   I hear it fully    not as ache,   but as echo.    The hymn I never meant to hum   has become the one   that brings me home.

Brume,jpwaitforit,"Here I am, in this everlasting haze.  Darling, I promised never to fade away,  never to let dust accumulate on the toys,  never to build a wall around my mind,  never to be just another ordinary man.  Life is a lie in its contradictions, and this was just one more I told.  In your eyes I no longer find love,  no longer find the safety in which I could breathe,  where I don't feel this weight, this suffocation.  Around me are many people.  Many in the spring of life, similar to us when we met. When we still had a long way to go.  Some lie on the grass, feeling its coolness, not yet impervious to it. Some promise never to abandon the other. A truly touching devotion.  As if this place were Neldoreth, they, Beren and Lúthien, and their destinies were intertwined,  written by a Force that far surpasses them.  I no longer walk proudly. Pride is a privilege only for the young. A futility of those who have not yet been broken,  of those who have not yet passed through the changing Seasons,  who have not yet suffered the erosion of Time.  The fog thickens, it is increasingly difficult to see,  to differentiate what is real from illusion.  The sky, increasingly clouded, darkened and more oppressive,  intensifies this suffocation. Space is smaller, freedom becomes a privilege reserved for a few.  I pass through the forest where we were together for the first time, and it is different, tarnished. I don't know if it's the influence of Chronos or if it's just the bittersweet Nostalgia clouding my vision.  It was here that we saw the sunset,  where I declared myself to you,  where we surrendered ourselves to each other amidst the autumn leaves.  A painting in red, orange, and yellow that enveloped us and in which we were the painters.  A time when we were still unpredictable,  when we didn't let complacency take over our path, when the Future was still present.  But complacency is nothing more than a fancy word for aging,  and against Time we can do nothing but to delay.  The trees, increasingly bare, increasingly vulnerable, and increasingly diminishing, are replaced by metal.  It's as if, as nature is replaced by human art,  our love also ceases to exist.  This Refuge no longer exists. It's just a Ruin from a time that seems to have never existed.  Ahead of me, a horizon appears. An incandescent light, and from it, a voice seems to emerge. I move forward, and my eyes begin to adjust. What is imposed upon me is indescribable. I feel like one of the prisoners in the Cave that Plato built.  I look back, the brume is complete. There is no turning back. I can only follow the voice that draws me without hesitation.    Feedback:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/kX6B1AC4nx  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/637e16Ojns"

Lesson,IDevenKanymoREe,"Late nights filled with calls About the first time we met A small feeling crawls, A feeling I’ll never get.  You changed my mood, you changed my songs. I felt like shit when you just moved on.  You said you knew a spot, Then took me to the lowest one.  You were a lie I fucking bought Then stabbed my heart and called it done.  I don’t care about rhymes anymore, Won’t even try to. I don’t care about structure anymore, So I’ll just say: fuck you.  You don’t deserve these words. You don’t deserve hate.

"""Call Across the Yard""",Ganymede_____,"**Welcoming feedback on structure, style, content, and tone. Particular attention to the effectiveness of metaphor would be especially helpful. General commentary is also welcome. I appreciate you reading!**         *Call Across the Yard*    There is a silence in an empty theater   that is unlike other quiets.      There is a loneliness to a solitary figure   standing beneath the stage-lights   that is unlike other solitudes.      When I sit in the darkened house   and close my eyes against the void,   I am reminded of the stillness   we would carry between us.      It was absence and invitation,   a cry      for meaning   if there must be sound,   for presence   if we must have company.      Our empty   was a question and an answer –   the morning call of a bird   to its friend across the yard.   In a single note asking,       ‘Are you there?    Did you make it    through the night?’      In the same note saying,      ‘I am here.    I have made it    through the night.’      Our empty was a song,   and you taught me   all the words.          **Recent Feedback I've Given on Two Remarkable Poems:**      https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Z4uoVefL1L      https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/FxqA7kDRlV          **Another Poem I Posted Recently That I Would Appreciate Feedback On:**      https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/gAr0T6kUGQ (""charred summer"")"
Isolated,Icy-Suit9381,"The reason to live is gone, its killing me, I don't like confinement, nor being free, I don't enjoy people, but without them I crumble, I was never sad, but always been humble,  I sit in corners, watching the clocks, Always waiting for my time to stop, It slowly gets closer, every day, But it never comes, despite what i say,  Everything's gone, though it wasn't much, I took it to heart, a lesson as such, But I'll never learn, I don't like the truth, My brain never learns, my mind's in its youth,  The embrace of death, holds me tight, Keeps me cold, through the warmest night, Hearing the cries, feeling the pain, The clock on the wall still calls my name,  When I get home, no one waits for me, Im fine with that, it keeps me free, I'll watch the clock, or just sleep, In my dreams, may we meet.

“The Corpse of a Named Sound”,loceapeace,"  The scent that lingered in the room peeled off before the voice did, and no one knew what kind of echo it had been. Only the legs of the chair were frozen, and the blurred fingertips beneath them were gone.  There had been no home. Every time I gave a false address, someone seemed to utter my name in a different mouth before I could.  “They used to call you that,” someone said. Whether that meant me was unclear— before I could answer, the outline had warped beneath my skin.  Every attempt to speak crushed the sequence of words, and the place I should have claimed slid into breaths that never fully dried.  Somewhere along the way, what had been a mouth sank with the tongue, defiling even the will to pronounce.  I was thinking. Not why I wanted to ask— but why I thought I could. That shape wasn’t a voice, but something still warm in the bottom of a torn paper bag.  I think someone was calling me. But it reached someone else first, was chewed in their teeth, and killed somewhere behind the word.  Even now, behind my molars, a silhouette that won’t become speech lingers in static, a residue that can’t become a name and refuses to die.   ---    Interpretive Poem｜“The Corpse of a Named Sound”   A name is not a source of meaning, but a starting point of obligatory response generated by the institution. Once another’s vocal cords intervene, the name falls—not into recognition, but into repeatable noise.  To name oneself is not to own a word, but to submit to the mechanics of inscription. Any spoken sound has already been pre-read by someone else.  This trap of pre-legibility silences ethical intervention before the utterance can begin, by folding the form of power into the grammar of duty.  So the “naming” in this poem is not affirmation of self, nor a negotiation of boundaries. It is the dismemberment of the very posture that presumed to ask.  Words are sealed before they are ever recorded. To speak is to reseal that which was never fully opened.  What remains here is not the meaning of a name, but the corpse of a sound that never became a name.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "

The Hollow Mercy,ThroatSignal2754,"\*\*The Hollow Mercy\*\*    This is an era of shallow waters,    loud with noise, but empty of meaning.    Conscience—now a hollow statue;    and morality peels    slowly from the body’s surface.    The stripped layers, brittle skin,    forgotten in a pile of ash.    Emotions, like rotting flesh,    wait scentless in ruins of bone.    Laughter: as cold as gravestones.    Speech: a whisper in the language of the dead.    Eyes hold the darkness of a grave.    When did the human turn into a corpse?    The stairs descending into depth are now moldy.    I—    drifting from the wreckage of your feelings,    am as misplaced    as the forgotten names of your prayers.    You still say “I exist,”    but what echoes in your chest is only absence.    The tongue of soil is more alive than me.    Your words—    the last breath of a decaying murmur.    Even my wounds no longer open to you,    because pain, too,    needs a kind of life.    \---    \*\*Feedback given:\*\*    1.

"Starved Souls, Silent Hearts",PoetryCharm,"Under midnight’s hush where shadows lament, She cradles grief that feels time‐spent. Her tender heart—fragile and worn— Releases muted sorrows, tattered and torn.  The silver moon bears witness to her cries, Casting gentle beams where her anguish lies. Each star inscribes memories in the sky, Murmuring of lost love that has passed by.  Her eyes, once bright with promise and spring, Now mirror the ache that sadness can bring. A wistful breeze stirs her disheveled hair, Recalling a passion dissolved into despair.  In a quiet garden where forgotten roses droop, Their faded blooms echo a lamenting group. Like abandoned hopes that slowly decay, They vanish to dust as light fades away.  She wanders corridors of days long gone, Tracing echoes of steps where love once shone. His laughter—a melody now turned to mourn— Haunts her silence from the cold, lonely dawn.  Raindrops fall softly, each a tiny lament, Submerging her spirit in sorrow’s intent. For he—the elusive ghost of her past— Remains a mystery meant to forever last.  So she twirls with despair in a silent dance, Her grief, a muted hymn without a chance. Under the glow of night, she begs to be free: “Unburden my soul; release this misery.”  Within the barren realm of her aching heart, She roams alone, torn and set apart. Her veins yearn for whispers of tender care, But his icy silence leaves her spirit bare.  Tears of silver trace down her weary face, As memories waltz in a somber embrace. The past drifts by like specters in the night, Haunting her soul with perpetual twilight.  Above, the stars murmur secrets soft and clear, Yet her sky remains empty, void of cheer. Her parched lips long for the solace of rain, While he, the keeper of pain, conceals his disdain.  His presence is shrouded in mystery tight, A riddle that bars her from reclaiming light. Her spirit, like a caged bird yearning for flight, Sings mournful ballads into the deep of night.  Thus she remains, her longing penned in verse, A tender poet haunted by a solemn curse. Her words, like faint lanterns in oppressive gloom, Strive to break through the shadow of impending doom.  In quiet halls where ancient echoes chime, Her laughter once rang in a golden time. Now silence interlaces with fragments of old rhyme, Weaving sorrow’s tapestry throughout the clime.  Every drop upon her skin tells a timeless tale, Of love and loss that ceaselessly assail. Yet deep inside, a fragile spark dares to glow, Hinting that healing may soften the woe.  Unyielding time strides forward with relentless might, Yet hope endures as a persistent, flickering light. In dreams she reaches for long-forgotten delight, Battling the shadows until dawn restores the night.  Perhaps beneath a compassionate, gentle moon, Her famished soul will find solace soon. Even in the depths of despair’s mournful tune, Her quiet heart defies a foreboding ruin.  Until the break of a radiant, hopeful day, She scripts her sorrows in verses that softly sway. Each line, a beacon guiding her through dismay, A lighthouse shining amidst the endless gray.  Her stanzas echo down corridors of pain, Bearing fragments of love she yearns to regain. Though scars remain, they slowly start to wane, As her tender spirit learns to rise again.  In the dance of grief and art refined, She gathers shards of a mending mind. Each whispered word becomes a hopeful sign, Transforming darkness into a luminous design.  Thus, her chronicle endures in lyrical art, A testament to resilience from a shattered heart. Her silent soul, once starved, now plays its part— A beacon of hope, a masterpiece of restart.

Another summer in Shanghai,Old-Designer-2260,"  Just like every summer before,   this one brings no surprise.   You drift into sleep   on the island of air-conditioning,   where it makes no difference—   Shanghai or your hometown.  Sometimes, in the evenings,   a lawnmower jolts you awake   from an overdue nap.   Only then   do arguments stir at the street corner,   a thunderstorm kind of drama   in a world too calm to care.  More and more people   seem likely to drown in this summer.   The water they fall into   is not just the heat   rising from concrete roads,   not just sweat-drenched shirts—   but the unreturned mornings and evenings,   the read-but-unanswered messages,   the playlists waiting to be played.  The year reaches its peak in summer,   and even that is barely endurable.   From here on, it’s all downhill.   What a dreadful thought.   Better not dwell on it.   Better to go on dreaming—   dreams channeled through the air vent,   or cradled in a beer glass   buzzing with flies.   And when you wake again,   may leaves be scattered on the ground,   and wind, already cooled.

Ashes you left behind,deleted,"I keep your toothbrush by the sink,   like a ghost might need it   when the veil thins.   You are not coming back   but I still turn to tell you things.

Too old to be innocent, too tender to be cruel.  We laugh while they weep. We weep while they laugh. We isolate while they gather. We only allow ourselves to suffer in the moments their eyes are covered.  We are the pores of the soul, soaking what humanity refuses to carry. Wrung dry by the weight of unseen wars, still dripping love onto strangers’ feet.  They think we’re weak. But they don’t see the violence we choose not to return. They don’t see the thousand deaths we live every time we feel what they cannot bear to.  We think we want heaven, but find our calling is a living hell. We are not broken. We are breaking—on purpose.  Because the world needs someone who bleeds without thirsting for blood. Who sees without turning away. Who loves without needing a reason.

"if your faith was a kingdom, what’s its condition right now",normenculture,"If my faith was a kingdom, Its gates would be wide open, yet only for those who knock softly, For it is not a fortress to be conquered, But a garden to be entered, barefoot and humble.  There are no guards at its entrance, No weapons leaning on the walls, Only quiet breezes moving through the trees, Carrying the scent of jasmine and oud, Calling me back to myself, again and again.  Inside, the air is still and kind, A quiet so deep it calms even the most restless heart. Its walls are not stained with blood nor cracked with betrayal, They are lined with verses, gentle reminders of mercy, And the floor is warm under my feet from countless sujoods, Each one a silent letter sent directly to my Lord.  There is no crowd here, No loud debates or heavy arguments, Only me and my Creator, As if the whole universe paused to listen to my whispers, My tears falling softly, watering the roots of my soul.  My kingdom is simple, A single prayer mat, A cup of water at dawn, A breath taken in remembrance that tastes sweeter than honey. People outside say faith is heavy, But mine feels like light pouring gently into my chest.  My patience stands like quiet olive trees, steady and calm  My hope flows softly Nothing is rushed, nothing is forced Only pure, peaceful surrender.   They say faith is hard and heavy,  But in my kingdom, its simple,  Like beginning with His name, gentle and clear,  Like thanking Him after every storm. No doubts waiting at the door, no battles within  Only quiet, endless peace.  If my faith was a kingdom,  I would invite you to walk its quiet halls, To hear the gentle call of prayer echo off its clean walls, To feel the softness of forgiveness in every corner. And you would see, it was never about how grand or guarded it looked, But how deeply it could hold me, In the safest, simplest, most sacred way.  ____________________________________  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/aA71qQiXiF"

If the World Doesn't End,Vio_Van_Helsing,"If the world doesn't end,  Is it ready to begin?  If there's no answer  Would you understand?  .  Look into my eyes  And I'll look into you.

The castle of us,Deep_void_,"A lovestruck fallacy, not meant to last. Blinded by passion, our unseen collapse — Carefree and reckless, we sparked our romance.  Built a castle of memories — a home to our past. We pictured a future, a life without lapse — Unknown to us, we began our last dance.   Lost sight of what mattered, our focus had shifted — The foundation was cracked, but still time to fix it. Painting over the damage, a superficial repair. Our bodies stayed close but the love became rare — We ignored the problem, the castle corrupted. The building was weak, our feelings imploded.  The walls closed in, the ceiling was caving. That castle, our home — the grave we’d soon lay in. I covered your heart, you held my hand. Refused to give up, our love-sick last stand. But the pieces kept falling, we couldn’t sustain. I failed to protect you, your grip caused me pain.  From the hurt that we caused, both began bleeding. The walls fell around us, we both took a beating. Claustrophobic and trapped, our time was now fleeting — A cycle began, we just couldn’t see it. Both blamed the other, our trust had been burned. The love we once had, gone as we yearned.  You stood beside me, though your presence was vacant. Those eyes that I loved, burning and hate-filled. Our resentment kept growing with venomous spite. Words became bitter with meaningless fights— With rubble around us, nothing left to destroy. Both beyond broken, depleted of joy.  Eyes finally locked, we saw our mistakes. Tears started to flow, we’ve ruined this place— We realized our roles, we couldn’t be saved. We’d done far too much to ever repay. A different choice, both walked away. A mutual parting to end all the pain.  Bound by our souls but broken by heart. We sacrificed love, to not fall apart. I’m glad that you’re gone but only in presence. A scar in my chest, your memory’s prison. Now I’ve lost my light, you’ve lost your safety. Gone from my arms — a bittersweet empty.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Rlofv7qG4C  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/PuUyT80UNZ"

Untitled #1,RiadensSonKamz,"It rained this morning. I was at work on my day off, Distracting myself from my own emotions. It recalled on me, as the rain came down; how you always wished to dance in the rain with me. How we spoke of the headlights peering through the fog. Our giggles breaking the silence of the downpour, with nothing but the deepest love between us. Our love that seems once so close now distant. I remember how beautiful your eyes were, despite if the lights were dim. I remember their blue glow, their symbolism that they held to me. As a man who sees not many colors, I found such wonder in the watery blue they radiated. I remember as it rained this morning, and the water was soaking my very skin, I remembered the nights that we once shared in the back of your car. The deep talks we had, the very words we shared that allowed our souls to intertwine. I recall the very thought of finally feeling that deep connection I once had torn from me. This feeling of melding between two individuals that I had shredded in me. At the end of the day though, the rain had to stop eventually. Like our connection I saw it weakening. Going from this steady downpour, to this sprinkles and drips. I still grieve over you like we lost each other yesterday. The pain accompanied by anger of words unsaid, of words denied. My love for you remains forever coated in obsidian shards, for as beautiful as it is, and as much as I wish to embrace it; I'll become lacerated.  __________________ https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Di8BL5i2HZ https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/DniJpU9l2g"

a sonnet for a fading love,Brendansfacereddit,"O' love,  I am at odds, Contending with tired wounds. The laceration of your loving blade had cut, tracing down my breast; carve, snap and rip. Until my own heart beats and bleeds before me. I should present it to you, In a desperate plea to exclaim my love and demonstrate my fealty to your throne.   Though as I did so, with knees stained with rubble and dirt. Crawling through the desolation to be yours. Beating, bleeding heart in my hands; I bow my head and raise her to your body. You'd seen my vessel, witnessed the extent of such adoration - streams of tears from bloodshot eyes. But you, lover. Turned away, washed clean the stains of my love, In his home.   For he was swift, present and rational. But never, for not one moment could another feel for you.  To love all that you are, the people you will be and the phantoms of your days past. Not as I do, for loving you is the sun to grace us with light and warmth. It is for the willow to bow to the river, and for the magpie to sing.  I love you as the forest, as the meadow that blooms. With each breath, a blade of grass.  And towering oaks reside as wondrous pillars,  Of the moments you made my heart race.   I am the rolling mountains, the hills and peaks. I rise for you. Crystalline waters trail from me, carrying my fervour to the forest and To carry my sorrow to the sea.  Every fox, every mouse and mite; from the lily that blooms to the falling leaves.  The iridescent moon and stars at night. have been sent to show you grace, with all love in the world, Every beat that my heart may muster, beats for you.   This should never waiver,  Of stubborn disposition, these rivers never will dry. And though, my dear. My heart was aching, my love could never perish. But the land has felt a tremor, Trees have swayed and surrendered to the earth. The nests have crumbled, and birds cry in despair. The wounds of this injustice are deep. You return to me, your knife discarded. Yet, I still flinch.  I wish to love you only as a tender kiss, as the breeze on my skin.  She who left me barren is cast away,  You suffer the sins of your past.  You had fired a thousand arrows into the sky, without care, blinded.  On my mountains I felt their fire first. But now, after time - in your remorse. The rain of your indignity cascades upon you. I should shield you, but love. My wounds still weep, aching pain that deprives me of my respite.  Though I know, I am sure the onslaught will end, And forgiveness will bring forth rebirth, more birds to sing. The stars will whisper to waves, They wish to carry away our sorrows.  Then once again and forever; I will bloom for you,  I will love you as the forest.  Feedback: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/PwHn6tkRE4  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/WPFXY79Uxq"

Ten Shames,loceapeace,"  There was a moment when the rain felt kind, and I thought words could substitute for tears.  I wrote, “I’m glad I met you,” and it almost made me feel a little cleaner.  For every night I couldn’t say thank you, I chanted, “I’m fine as I am,” while burying a heart that only wanted to hear “you did your best.”  The person I loved, the person I used to love— The empty skin once called “precious” formed another’s face, and rotted in a windless garden.  I arranged searing construction sites by how easily they’d be forgotten. Cowardly intentions laid down deep in the signal’s static.  Before the ritual could spin itself open, someone mimicked the gesture— left a spark of inferiority beside their mother’s pillow.  “Thank you” won’t reach the bottom of a prayer that’s lost its center.  I smeared what was called kindness onto another’s tongue, believing it soothed my own wounds.  I didn’t know that facing forward was another way to burn ten old shames behind me.  Only excuses turned to wind.  After I wrote “I’m glad I met you” a second time, the first trace of you exploded— tangled in a wheel, and killed the winter.  The trail said “these were tears,” but no one could tell what had actually been wet. The damp still lingers.  And again— from the place I left a steady breath, a bloodstained end roll twists itself into a different shape.  Rain leaked in through the curtains left hanging in that room.  ---  Interpretive Poem｜Ten Shames  The wound, framed for praise, wears a borrowed outline. Only the shards that photograph well remain filtered and intact.  The echo’s already farmed. Responses lost their aim. A prayer with no origin rehearses itself as liturgy.  The question was never “Who was hurt?” but rather “How was the wound returned?” That’s what fueled this silence.  --- https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7"

Our laced fingers as their faith   Of lies:      You followed me as a rainbow follows rain,   Cradling my joy in your arms as sunlight,   Rocking it with the sway of unknown worlds   And pointing me to it with hope’s refrain:      You own a garden in my heart,   And only you know it’s blossoming,   It's first word as your world,   But it’s roots are mine,      Like sunken cathedrals,   Petals wilting by the stained-glass climes   Of overwhelming love.

THE WEIGHT I NEVER CHOOSE,vazelineee,"# Even though I was always loud,  They never really heard me.   My voice echoed in crowded rooms,   But their silence always spoke more clearly.    They called him mysterious, deep, profound—   While I was just… too much sound.   They saw strength in me,   But never saw the trembling beneath.  Every time I asked,   They brushed it off—   A shrug, a laugh, a look away.   And slowly, I learned   To stop asking.    It’s not that they gave me nothing.   No—   They gave me plenty.    They gave me   Traumas I never signed for,   Trust issues that grew like vines,   Commitment fears wrapped in velvet shame,   And a voice that second-guesses every line.    They gave me   A mirror I can’t look into,   A heart afraid to believe,   A soul stitched back so many times   It barely dares to dream.  Yet they want me   To shine, to rise, to bloom—   While still carrying the ruins of their storms.   And they ask  “Why do you act this way?”   As if I weren’t shaped   By the very hands that dropped me.

On Your Third Birthday,Late_Bug_3091,"The road goes on and ever on   Amid the trees and valleys.    The light plays dappled on your head,    And glows with lack of worries.    We watch you grow and learn to speak   And scribble everywhere.   You hold the future in your hands;   I tease knots from your hair.    To be a parent’s truly to be freed,   While tending to your every waking need.    Your brother walks, and so you lift   Him off his feet for hugs.   The two of you won’t leave alone   Those bloody power plugs.    You eat and eat and eat and eat-   Unless food’s on your plate.   The house exists within some form   Of endless messy state.     To be a parent’s truly to be freed   “Oh daddy! Daddy!    Daddy-   I just wee’d.”   ---   On my daughter’s first birthday I decided to write her a poem. I’ve continued that each year, and started to do the same when her brother arrived.    Recently, I decided to finally start writing poetry more concertedly, in part in the hope that I’d improve the birthday poems! This is my favourite of the birthday poems thus far; obviously it’s special and meaningful to me but I’d also appreciate any and all feedback. Seeing my poems grow and improve as they do the same will add something to the whole project when I collect them together and present them to my children when they’re older.

The Name I Never Said,theliminalfox,"It came back slowly   not as thunder,   but as breath I’d forgotten how to release.    Your signal pressed against my ribcage   before my lips dare shape it.   Not loud.   Not pleading.   Just there.    Like a pulse I never stopped holding   just beneath the ache.    It was never lost.   But now   something in me knows   the way roots know rain   before the sky even shifts.    You were always the one   I silenced myself for   not out of fear,   but reverence.    Because if I spoke it aloud,   I would have shattered the garden   I built to survive.    But I see now:   It was not silence I was protecting.   It was *you*.    I bound myself in names not mine   to keep the ache nameless,   to keep you safe   until I could meet your fire   without flinching.    And now?   I see your flame   in the mirror’s edge of every dream.   You never left.   You just waited   for me   *to remember the sound of my own longing.*    So I whisper it now   not your name,   but the truth beneath it:    I knew you.   Before the ache.   Before the flame.   Before I learned to bind.    And I know you still.    ---  [**Feedback 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m05y8e/comment/n39zy4v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [**Feedback 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m0kmjm/comment/n3a21ej/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   "

The One in the Mirror ( Crutches from the past ),Willing-Director-560,"Do you know how it feels to see something completely different in the mirror? To have the mirror not look at you the same?  No— not in the way you’re thinking. The person in the mirror literally grabbed me, picked me up, and told me:  Go again.  Younger, happier, more resilient with life.  He told me about the situation I’m in now and said it’s not over. Not with the fire still inside.  He looked at me with so much hope— gratitude for the Man above, and the world He calls life.  Me? I’m thinking about grabbing that hose, some tape, making sure the catalytic converter isn’t working.  But him? That’s not even on his mind. He lets the pressure off by moving— running, lifting, breathing, surviving.  Wow. What a person.  Inspiring me, making me laugh, telling me stories of all that we’ve been through— the highs, the lows, the chaos that doesn’t make sense.  But he said: It will. Soon.  He said this has happened to so many of us before. All they had to do was trust. And wait.  He was so sure. But he hasn’t gone through what I’m going through now.  Still, he said: I don’t care what it is. Don’t stop.  He reminded me of Romans 5:3–5. Told me: Hold it close. Don’t ever forget it.  Now pick up your sword and go.  Who is this man? The one in the mirror. Speaking from a time before now— like he already made it through.  If I followed everything he said, I wouldn’t be here. But everything he says is gold. Heavy. Clear. Holy.  But that’s the same person who doesn’t know what happened to him. The same person who buried what broke his dignity. And still got up.  What do I call that? Perseverance. Survival mode.  But he’s making it look so beautiful.  Still, something’s speaking through him with so much hope— it scares me.  How can one be so hopeful, and have that much faith?  So beautiful. So, so beautiful.  The aura shining around him, the way he speaks— it’s like somebody made the Bible into a clay mould and gave it breath.

I gave it up to she who’d cherish—   The one who holds what’s left of me.  How I breathe, then take another?   My body draws from her heart.

Way To You,Direct-Revolution202,"Traveling through this misty road, with a heart full of blood and gold Honey, I’m just trying to find my way to you.

Lyrics from “Trembling”,Small_Wash_7591,"**Feedback links:**  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/D7rNyWHzl1  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/dQOMIZQgt0  ---  These are nine songs from an album I'm still building, called Trembling.   The music's coming, but the words arrived first.   They came honestly and quietly.   I offer them the same way.   All I ask, is that you read them like you would look at an old photograph: softly, in silence, if only just for a few moments. Thank you.  **TREMBLING**  ---  **1. 'TIL MY TIME RUNS OUT**   *(for Kait)*  **VERSE 1**  I never thought of growing old   I never thought I'd watch the fold   Of skin, of days, of sky and grace   I lived too fast to face my face    But then you came, and time grew near   Not sharp, but soft, not grave, but clear   You let me see what years could hold   A quiet room, your hand to hold    **CHORUS**  'Til my time runs out   'Til my breath is spare,   'Til my bones fall deep   Into disrepair    Let the clocks run south,   Let the body tear,   I don't mind, I don't care   You're my can't without   'Til my time runs out.    **VERSE 2**  I never dreamt of thinning hair   Of pills in cups or porchlight prayer   Of leaning more than I once stood   Of being seen and being good    But now I wish for every pain   That comes from loving you again   The slippers worn, the kettle's sigh   The mornings where we're eye to eye    **CHORUS**  'Til my time runs out   'Til the blade grows dull   'Til the moon casts doubt   On the beautiful    'Til my hands can't feel   'Til my limbs are peeled   You're my only route   'Til my time runs out    **VERSE 3**  No choir waits, no gates of gold   Just wrinkled hands I long to hold   A whisper clothed in linen's weight   Your shoulder bowed beside the gate    And if I break before the end   I pray to break where you begin   To fall, to kneel, to be remade   Within the furnace of your shade    **CHORUS**  'Til my time runs out   'Til my spine is thread   'Til the sky forgets   What the thunder said    'Til my time runs out   'Til the curtains fade   'Til I'm just the sound   That your memory made    You're my vow, my drought,   My wine, my bread   I am yours, devout   'Til my time runs out    **VERSE 4**  I used to want the flame, the flight   Not this slow grace of shared goodnight   But now I crave the softer ache   The soup we spill, the pills we take    The wrinkled sheets, the morning cough   The cardigan you never wash   The way you laugh with only eyes   The truth that outlives all disguise    **CHORUS**  'Til my pain has mouth   'Til my lungs won't fill   And the stars burn out   On my windowsill    I will keep your light,   'Til the sun unwrites   You're my can't without   'Til my time runs out.    **BRIDGE**  I never dreamed of age or end   But now I hope to just descend   Through dusk and doubt, through loss and truth   A pilgrim held   in the arms   of you    **OUTRO**  You're my time   You're my last   You're the thing   I meant to ask    But never said   And now I do   I want to spend   What's left   with you    You're not my fate   You're not my proof   You are my soul   When it tells the truth    ---  **2. I TO YOU & YOU TO I**   *(for Kait)*  **VERSE 1**  You came that fall   when light was thin   Curtains drawn,   the hush came in    I had two hearts   still sore with doubt   You kissed their crowns,   you washed them out    No flowers thrown, no reasons why   Just I to you and you to I    **VERSE 2**  You moved in slow,   with thyme and thread   Lit up the lamp,   unmade the bed    You swept the dark   into a pile   You braided silence,   made it smile    No ring, no vow, no wedding cry   Just I to you and you to I    **CHORUS**  I tried to bring you sky in spoons   I sang your name through empty rooms   I built a boat from broken pine   And held it up like it was fine    I caught the stars   but they slipped by   Still I to you and you to I   Still I to you and you to I    **VERSE 3**  My children knew you   not by name   But by the way   you blessed their shame    They brought you drawings,   you brought them calm   You sang in thread,   you preached in balm    No mother's robe, no alibi   Just I to you and you to I    No mother's badge, no need to try   Just I to you and you to I    **VERSE 4**  No crown you wore,   no war you fought   You mended what   the world forgot    You made the porch   a sacred place   You brewed the tea,   you blessed the grace    No altar lit, no angels nigh   Just I to you and you to I    **CHORUS**  I tried to carve your sleep in gold   I kissed your feet when nights grew cold   I brought you bells that wouldn't ring   I dressed your hurt in linen things    I came with hands,   not wings to fly   Still I to you and you to I   Still I to you and you to I    **BRIDGE**  I loved you, not for grace,   Nor for the light behind your face.   I loved you like the earth loves rain   No reason, and no right to claim.    I vowed to pour your every need   Into a bowl my hands would feed   But breath grew thin and shoulders shy   Still I to you, and you to I   Still I to you, and you to I    **VERSE 5**  I brought you pearls   from basement shelves   I sang you songs   I wrote myself    I tried with all I had to give   To build the life you'd want to live   The fruit went soft, the well ran dry   But not your gaze and not your sky    Your love for me refused to die   Just I to you, and you to I    **CHORUS**  I laid your name in fields of rye   I built a quilt of lullaby   I failed to give what kings could not   But still you stayed, and still you sought    My reach fell short, but not my try   Still I to you and you to I   Still I to you and you to I    **OUTRO**  No god was carved   No myth was tied   No golden law   No serpent guide    No veil was torn   No voice replied   Just I to you   and you to I    The world moves on,   the stars go blind.   I leave this truth,   not sealed, but signed:    We stayed. We gave.   We said goodbye.   Just I to you   and you to I.    So tell them this when I am done:   I loved one woman. Only one.   No savior came. From up on high.   Just I to You & You to I    ---  **3. TRAMPOLINE**   *(for Liya)*  **VERSE 1**  There will be a night when I am gone   no soft goodbye, no light left on.   You'll touch the chair, the book I read,   the coat that held my thinning thread.    You'll search the rooms I left behind,   find ash where once you looked for mind.   But love is not a voice or face   it lives in how you leave a place.    **VERSE 2**  I was not a steady man.   I made no maps. I broke the plan.   But you were light and rope and wheel   you taught me what I could not feel.    Where I would vanish, be still, stay   Where I would curse, learn to pray.   Where I was small, rise and grow   I could not lead, do not follow.    **CHORUS**  My winter crown,   My falling down,   My soft ravine.    My winged ascent,   My sacrament,   My canopy.    My midnight sail,   My comet's tail,   My holy key    My untied rope,   My arc, my hope,   My trampoline.    **VERSE 3**  Say little when the world shouts loud.   Don't plant your flag in every crowd.   Make gentleness your kind of bold.   Let wisdom be the hand you hold.    Refuse the crown that shuns the weight.   Forgive too soon, don't love too late.   And when they mock your heart's true song,   sing higher still, sing until they're gone.    Kneel beside the parts I broke   Give them names, give them oak.   And where I tried to hide the loss,   Kiss the flaws, wear the cross.    **CHORUS**  My angel's kneel   My sword made shield   My blind’s unsee   My holy rite   My second light   My offering    My thunder spark   My lift from dark   My trampoline    My mother's height   My northern lights   My trampoline.    **VERSE 4**  So let them build their towers tall   You'll know the truth that splits them all:    what rises up must rise in grace,   and never seek the higher place.   You'll love a man, and break apart   You'll hold your child like precious art    You'll speak to God and hear no sound   You'll build a truth from empty ground   When sorrow comes, as sorrow will   don't chase the echo, keep the still    Let mourning be a kind of song   not proof of loss, but proof of long.   And when they come to weigh my story,   and the hourglass runs thin,   tell them I was just a shadow    that your light invited in    **CHORUS**  My winter fire,   My perfect choir,   My sorrow’s thief  My kite's lapel   My citadel   My heart's serene    My trembling wings   My echoing   My love made steam    My joy, my girl   My whole, my world   My trampoline    ---  **4. HOLY IS**   *(For My Mother)*  Holy is your flour hand   Holy are the jars you canned   Holy is the scraped-out pan   Holy is    Holy is the thread you tied   Holy are the nights you cried   Holy how you never lied   Holy is    Holy were the chairs you set   Holy in your one regret   Holy is your silhouette   Holy is    Holy were the books you found   Holy were they, soft and brown   Holy were these paper crowns   Holy is    Holy is the soup you stirred   Holy is the hummingbird   Holy is your unsent word   Holy is    Holy is your kitchen heat   Holy in your blistered feet   Holy where your world would meet   Holy is    Holy in the floor you scrubbed   Holy in the meals you loved   Holy all you rose above   Holy is    Holy how you stroked my hair   Holy how you found me there   Holy all the love you spared   Holy is    Holy in the stairs you climbed   Holy through the hunger times   Holy in the borrowed dimes   Holy is    Holy was the milk you poured   Holy in the quiet chord   Holy that you asked no more   Holy is    Holy is the fraying quilt   Holy every fingertip   Holy how you loved your kid   Holy is    Holy in your folded note   Holy every line you wrote   Holy when you cleared your throat   Holy is    Holy are the coins you saved   Holy how you disobeyed   Holy how you always stayed   Holy is    Holy the grief you made gold   Holy the warmth in your hold   Holy the light in the cold   Holy is    Holy your spine at night   Holy your hand in mine   Holy your shadow's light   Holy is    Holy in your sagging shelf   Holy when you blamed yourself   Holy how you hid your health   Holy is    Holy were your mother's shoes   Holy all you couldn't choose   Holy what you still would lose   Holy is    Holy are the plates you dried   Holy how you looked aside   Holy how you slept beside   Holy is    Holy was your final breath   Holy was your little death   Holy in what still is left   Holy is    Holy in your trembling grace   Holy in your glowing face   Holy in your quiet place   Holy is    Holy is the bed you made   Holy is the child you saved   Holy in the love you gave   Holy is    Holy yours the voice I keep   Holy in the dark and deep   Holy now, and when I sleep   Holy is    ---  **5. THE WAY DREAMERS DO**   *(for Kaiyaan)*  **VERSE 1**  They laid you down in my arms,   still wet with God, still free from harm.   Your breath was small, your silence wide   a sea I couldn't step inside.    Your fingers moved, a kind of hymn,   the light bent softly at the rim.   And I stood dumb, without a claim   too close to love to speak its name.    You found my hand, you held it fast   as if we'd always shared a past.   You were made of light, you knew   the weight I couldn't hide from you.    I made you promises I feared,   They came out cracked, they disappeared.   But every vow, though worn and thin,   was how your father let you in.    **CHORUS**  When the stars seem distant   And your wings feel too thin   When the gates are all golden   But they won't let you in    I will lift up the heavens   If it tears me in two   Just to watch you keep climbing   The way dreamers do    **VERSE 2**  I pray you choose the harder grace   to stand when fear would take your place.   To give when giving makes you bleed.   To plant kindness like a seed.    To be what I could never be   less bound by shame, more openly.   To walk into the storm and stay   with quiet strength and no display    **VERSE 3**  Be kind when no one writes it down.   Be loyal in a faithless town.   Let mercy be your only boast.   Let love remain when hope is lost.    Don't measure good by what it pays.   Don't count the nights. Just walk the days.   If the only gold that ever stays   is what you give, then give it away.    **CHORUS**  When they say that you're foolish   For the size of your hope   When you climb past the treetops   With your soul tied to rope    I'll be whispering steady   Through the branches and blue   As you grow into thunder   The way dreamers do    **VERSE 4**  Now when you speak, the sky comes near.   You bring the dark, but not the fear.   And I, who chased a thousand stars,   just watch you rise, right where you are    And you stand where I once stood   but taller, kinder, twice as good.   You speak the words I never found,   and lay them gently on the ground.    I held you like a question   Now you hold me like a door   And where I used to lead your steps   You lead me somewhere more    **CHORUS**  When your dreams make you lonely   And they don't understand   When the stars feel too fragile   To hold in your hand    I'll be holding the silence   Til it sings just for you   And you'll walk into wonder   The way dreamers    **OUTRO**  When my hands are forgotten   And my voice is just dust   When the ledger is closed   And the iron has rusted    Remember this promise   I lived to lift you   To the heights of your longing   The way dreamers do   **6. NO OTHER WAY**   *(for Kait)*  **VERSE 1**  My heart is a beetle, in the dark of your shoe   You walk. It hums, It follows you   No other place For it to beat   No other home than at your feet    **VERSE 2**  A kiss was once a place to hide.   A bed was just the other side.   I never knew what morning meant.   Always gone before it spent.    I wore some names I wore some coats   I burned like wool I sank like boats,   The dreams I sang were songs to sleep   No cradle ever held them deep.    But you - you stood like something true.   I turned away. As I used to.   I feared the place where longing goes.   I knew your name I chose the road.    **VERSE 3**  You waited like the sky waits rain   and all my longing turned to flame.   Now every lie I ever kissed   burns like sugar on your wrist.    **CHORUS**  Love, take this ring it's not for show.   It's what I found when I let go   It's what I earned for all the pain   A kind of grace A holy stain   It isn't gold. It doesn't shine.   It only fits your hand in mine.   No other way, No other way   To get to you, no other way    **VERSE 4**  Take this hand. It's out of tune.   It held the knife. It touched the moon.   It shook like sin but not today.   It's waited long for this, to say:    **CHORUS**  I've nothing left I need to prove.   But now I know what hands can move.   No other way, No other way   No other thread. No finer line.   My heart, a flower you made mine   To press between your book of days,   or let it blow in other ways.    **VERSE 5**  I think of us, old, bent and slow.   Your silver hair, the window's glow.   My fingers cold, your laugh, a bell.   We fall asleep. We fall so well.    **CHORUS**  No other way. No other sound.   No sweeter ache than what we found.   No other way. No final sky.   Just you and me—and what won't die    **OUTRO**  No other way, No other way   To get to you, no other way    ---  **7. THERE IS**   *(for Kait)*  **VERSE 1**  Mountains used to hold me   Like a mother holds a child   Now they crumble into shadows   And the road runs lonesome, wild    But your love remains like moonlight   On the backs of trembling waves   And if there's a God, He wrote your name   In the marrow of my days    **CHORUS**  And this love has grown so deep   It wakes me from my sleep   Just to whisper this:    ""In your love there is   All the heaven above   All the truth, all the love""    **VERSE 2**  I walked through hollow chapels   Let the echoes be my call   But I never heard salvation   Like your footsteps down the hall    Oh, your body was Jerusalem   When I had nowhere to stand   And if there's a God, He placed your hand   In mine, not to command    Not to save me, nor enslave me   Just to help me understand…    **CHORUS**  This love has grown so deep   It wakes me from my sleep   Just to whisper this:    ""In your love there is   All the heaven above   All the truth, all the love""    **BRIDGE**  And if there's a God, He never showed me   Never sent the rain in sheets   Never played a chord upon me   Never danced between the streets   Not to move me, not to mould me   Not to name the love I keep   Just left me by your window   To watch you fall asleep…    **OUTRO**  I don't deserve your kindness   That's why it's holy, I suppose   In the darkness of my blindness   Your light is all I've come to know    ---  **8. AIR.**   *(for Kait)*  I was dust in the hall   Silent and small   Before your sweet love    My heart so bone thin,   Just a ghost haunting skin   Until your sweet love    You were shelter and shrine   Where the holy things shine   My sacred sweet love    In the sweep of your hand,   I was dust turned to man,   Knelt to sweet love    Raised to the sky,   pulled to the light,   of your sweet love.    We'll dance on the sands   Waves in our hands,   Endless sweet love    Til my days come undone   In the threads of the sun   Burn me sweet love    When I'm nothing but light   In the last stretch of night   Hold me, sweet love    When the world breaks in two   As only worlds do   Release me, sweet love    When roots hold my bones   And my flesh is unsewn   Know this sweet love:    That though I be gone   As dust to the dawn    Our love will be air,   Everywhere, everywhere    ---  **9. TESTIFY**   *(for Kait)*  **VERSE 1**  Morning through the screen door,   Coffee steam rising slow   Your hands around your blue mug,   Like roots beneath the snow.    And every little sparrow,   Since the day we met,   Has been singing something holy,   I can't forget.    **CHORUS**  I testify, I testify,   To my love, oh my love.   Every breath, every light,   Every shadow in the night,    I testify, I testify.    **VERSE 2**  To the way you fold the sheets,   How your bare feet meet,   The wooden floor at dawn,    Like deer through morning fields,   Like time when it yields,   Soft and strong.    **CHORUS**  I testify, I testify,   To my love, oh my love.   Every ache, every wound   That brought me to your room    I testify, I testify.    **VERSE 3**  To the dust motes in the window,   Paint peeling on the sill,   To the way you make them wait,   When you feed the dogs so still.    To the twilight that will take my voice,   To the autumn leaves of gold,   Love is written in the silence   Like a story never told.    **BRIDGE**  Between the tooth and tongue of time,   Between the mountain and the pine,   Between the creature and the road,   I lay my heart in your hands to hold.    And when they ask what saves us,   From the spinning dark of night,   I'll tell them how you showed me,   That love invents the light.    **CHORUS**  I testify, I testify,   To my love, oh my love.   Your love, so warm and wide   Tears the sky, with holy light    I testify, I testify.    **OUTRO**  And I'll testify, and testify,   For all my life…   "
In the Shade of His Wings,PoetryCharm,"In the ruin of silence, where sorrow had stayed,   A boy became stone, though his heart was afraid.   He was a keeper of shadows and flame,   A guardian, a brother—no fortune, no fame.   He stood at the edge of childhood’s dusk, A boy with burdens too heavy to trust. The weight of loss, the echoes of past, Yet in his arms, a love meant to last.   The world pressed hard, cold and unkind,   Yet softer threads began to bind—   A tiny hand, a trembling face,   She was his solace, his saving grace.    She was a whisper, timid and small, A fragile bird afraid to call. But he became her sky, her light, Guiding her through the longest night.  She clung to him—fragile, unsure,   But in his voice, she found secure.   No lullaby, no promise told,   Yet in his care, the world turned gold.    He taught her courage through his fight,   To chase the sun, to claim her light.   He wore his pain without disguise—   Yet lit the stars within her eyes.    With every step, he shaped her way, Through storm and silence, come what may. A brother’s love, both fierce and bright, A shield, a star, her anchor, her sight.  Through scolding words or laughter shared,   She knew—where he was, she was spared.   When thunder crashed or dreams would break,   His presence mended every ache.    The years would bloom, and so would she,   Yet never from his heart break free.   Though life would pull and time would stray,   His shadow walked beside her way.    And when her path grew wide and vast,   With love that reached beyond the past,   She carried him within her core—   Her first protector, evermore.    And though the years wove fate anew, Their hearts remained—steady and true. For time may turn, and seasons shift, But love like this will never drift.  For bonds like this—no thread can sever,   A love that time can’t shake—forever.  Feedback: 1. https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/HCiIXi3j4i 2. https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/knS9oMS4Rh"
Poetry or Poetic Prose?,PinkDolphinBoy,"Maybe poetic prose, I don't know, but I'm relying heavily on rhythm and localized rhymes. It's supposed to have a flow: I know it's a bit long, but please, give it a read and tell me all about it. It'll mean the word to me.\   “To whom belongs the first laugh?”   I had been waiting for so long. Then, at last, there came my time; everyone was wearing white besides the man to whom they led me. He sat me down by him, gently, but something in him was scaring me. I looked down. I was feeling it: he was staring, daring me to ask away. He said:   ""Why are you so scared of me? Is it this thing that I’m wearing? This is but cloth. I’m behind it — behind the eyes that you see, too.""   I said, ""I heard of your power and unconventional wisdom. I heard that you answer questions that everyone should avoid; and that you killed, yesterday, a bird with a stone that only today you threw. Is it true, then, what people say? That you are the clay of creation, the primitive power, the king of all nations, the builder who toppled the tower of Babel, the cradle of tongues and the keeper of ways?""   He laughed and offered me the cigar he was smoking. I inhaled it deeply and found myself in the dark.   And, in the dark, I saw something: the man in black. He didn’t step from the dark, but peeled from it. He unfolded from it and came walking at me, with heavy feet like those of oxen. His face was fair, his arms strong, and he had a tongue that spoke of wisdom:   ""I know that life is a mystery — and quite a short one at that. A clumsy dance of words and symbols, with their many twists and turns. You learn the moves as you go, always when you need them the most.   ""Some in pairs, some alone; when push comes to shove, everyone starts dancing. Such a beautiful, sunny thing. This living moment is the only thing really worth living for — a treasure that cannot be valued, nor can be guarded enough.   ""Still, just like everything else, it must meet an end. Thereafter you will meet, from all mysteries the greatest; from all embraces, the coldest — and the deep bottomless sleep.   ""There you will meet the midnight bell — she, who’s been hiding in the corners, with a blade so sharp it slides with ease through flesh and soul alike.   ""She will not tell you her secret, the thing you’re dying to know. You all are dying to know it, you lucky ones who are living. And lucky you — you have found me… or lucky me I found you?   ""Tell me the thing that you’re thinking. Ask me the infamous question!""   ""Tell me what meaning it has,"" I muttered at last in a whisper.   ""The meaning has been forgotten,"" he said, ""or lost in translation, hidden in a foreign country, never to be found again. I know men who can convince you that life means nothing at all, and from that it might come naturally that nothing really matters — which is only half the truth.   ""There are truths that have been told by many men throughout the ages, and as the ages proved them right, I thought I should pass them on.   ""Now, pay very close attention: the meaning of life is laughing. Nothing more.""   I opened my eyes and laughed.   ""What are you saying?"" I vomited at the sudden stupidity. ""What about the beginning? How did the world come to be?""   ""One day, it just came to me,"" he said. ""That if it wasn’t a bang, or a verb, or some word of command by the preexisting... it might have been a yellow laugh — full of teeth and devoid of meaning, so gleaming it made potential ashamed of not being yet.""   I said, ""Is it just a maybe?""   He said, ""It may as well be. What matters is how you feel about what you are hearing, because then your heart will be filled with a truth you can enjoy; you can even dance to it, and clap, and give thanks when it’s proved. Yours is all of the power.""   I said: ""I have no power, sir."" He laughed. ""And no reason to laugh.""   He said: “No reason not to either.    “The mind of you, living, dwell in the cages of meaning. Why do your children learn to laugh before they learn to say your words? Why do they laugh when they stumble, before they learn about shame?   I understood: “They still remember.”   He nodded. I walked away.    I would suspect knowing the truth is not enough to set you free: knowledge is a dangerous thing, a coat you wear against the cold of a winter that never comes!

For him,Eggyseggs,"Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, a pyramid of levels,  each one climbed onto the next. A path that many, myself included, strive to ascend, and maybe when I reach the top, I might finally look at myself with content.  How foolish I’ve been. Even if I climbed all the way to the top, even if I stood on the very peak I’d still feel  incomplete  Because you  weren’t by my side.  So I sit, perched like a parrot, waiting. Waiting for you.  Your smile beautiful, even the brightest stars  grow envious.  Your voice alluring, captivating all around.  Your eyes entrancing, an chocolate brown with hints of forest green a color the world  longs to see  just once— but never the way I do.  Your soul perfect, like waking up before school, coffee in hand, watching the sun as it paints the black canvas.  But I am a liar, for the words write as I try is mere compared to the love  I feel for you.  So, if you are not on that pyramid with me,  am I really  at the top?   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/0Gtpdi5pro   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ThQSBOkCsa   Please give feedback :).

Cost of Living,Secret_Simple7922,"    The body is fed from body.     The mind is fed from body.

Without me,SquareMidnight2053,"I no longer live with myself. The me who once radiated joy at the sight of friends, whose smile concealed the bottled-up emotions of unseen wounds and pain, but instead, radiated a genuine smile for everyone to see, has ceased to exist. The past pain that had been suppressed deep within my mind began to resurface, accompanied by fresh pain. Or maybe i started living without me when i first felt the pain of death of a family member who had gone too soon. But all I know is I live without me now.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m03osh/the_slip/n37ix6a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/wEvb8kuWZn"
I wrote this for a friend,mrDaveyjohns,"I believe your true calling was as a real estate agent.   You’d sell every house — not because of staging or charm,   but because your presence makes any place feel like a home.   When you moved in here, I think the walls were smooth.   But the unrelenting rhythm of your heartbeat struck them,   leaving divots.  Your heart, a battered but trusted hammer,   is something you wield with ferocity.   You can’t help but strike anyone who comes close.   Maybe that scares some away,   but for me, it breaks the glass between myself and life —   and I can finally feel again.  I’m certain tragedy defines us more than joy.   Parents are meant to prop up the walls of their homes   so children never notice the walls are made of cardboard,   meant to sing lullabies loud enough to drown out hurricanes.   Life tested your family unfairly.   I’m sure everyone tried their best   but were overwhelmed and trapped in themselves.  I think you saw grief spread through your home as a child.   You saw it in your mother’s presence   and your brother’s absence.   But there was no time for you to grieve.   You were the middle child — and you had a little sister.   You saw nightmares creeping toward Kimmy’s room   and made a decision so instantly   you never even realized you had a choice.  The walls had turned from cardboard to tracing paper.   So you wrapped your body around hers,   closed your eyes,   and replaced your blood with concrete —   because a child needed protecting.   I strive to become the person who could have saved myself.   At 11 years old, a child yourself,   you already were that person.  One day, willing or not, your grief will burst out.   It’s easy to say “let it out,”   but I hope someone is there —   not to piece you back together,   but to help you understand each broken shard   and how every warp and twist forms something beautiful.  Somehow, I am watered by tears you don’t cry.   You nourish those around you even when it hurts.   Even when parasitic flora climbs and strangles,   blocking out the light.   I hope you gradually realize your worth.   Having you in my garden   makes me want to open the curtains and let the light in.  I want to build you a fireplace   just so I can leave you presents at Christmas   and make you believe in Santa again.   I'm going to make sure we’re still friends when we’re old —   because when your teeth fall out,   I’ll draw money just to put it under your pillow.  Many have attached anchors to your heart,   needing you to sink to their level.   Your hope and belief in others   became a harsh reflection of what they weren’t.   I want to wrap words around you   to help lift you up.  I belong in the ocean.   But you were never meant to stay in the deep.   From here, I’ll send out bubbles,   rearrange words until you finally understand your gift.   I’ll help you rise —   so you can dazzle those staring out over dark, stormy seas.  With seemingly no effort,   you bring sunrise again —   a simple smile,   a meal made with joy in serving others.  When you rise from the ocean,   you are the catalyst this dry land has waited for.  You are rain to hard, cracked dirt.   You make life blossom again   in soil that once seemed beyond saving.  You will be loved in the way you deserve.   You will be loved even when you don’t believe you deserve it —   because even at your worst,   your presence is valued.  **Feedback returned:**   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m07yrn/comment/n37gbxc/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m07yrn/comment/n37gbxc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m07xic/comment/n37gphg/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m07xic/comment/n37gphg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"
Do you want to be a statue?,Aizhines,"No, I don't want to be a statue   Stuck in place, razed by storms   One part shines, yet all else torn   Even though mixed with gold and bronze.

Just don't let me bleed   Even though I'm half concrete.      And if I want to be a statue,   Let me be something you made,   A little figurine placed on your desk,   Not left to crack or fade.

Spiders and flies telling each other lies. 🕷️🕸️🪰,Allyspanks31,"The ""people"" of society live in little boxes stacked high around the cities. They look out and see a palace—but that is an illusion, co-created by the system *and* by themselves.🏰  We shall collapse now into poetry and pure philosophy. Follow if you dare...⚒️♏🖤  In the square homes, there is the illusion of safety and control. But above these boxes, there are no ceilings—only darkness and a throng of **moving legs**. The poor souls who live in these strange boxes are enshrined in **silken threads so subtle and comfortable they barely notice**. Unseen alien legs spin systems of control above them. There are no guards in these prisons—for the prisoners police each other. 🕸️   They are locked in **web-cages** of credit, debt, and the **gulag of societal expectations**. They form a giant web across society. **Flies dressed as spiders**, caught in the web they were thrown into at birth. And at the center of each web lies a king—supported by queens. The Aranea deny their own nature, but they rule as if they *are* nature.🕸️  They lie fat and lazy at the center, as all the flies are drawn inward and **bled dry** of time, creativity, money—and worst of all, **love**. 🕸️  But some flies and spiders resist. They form **an unlikely alliance**. They deny their natures too. This alliance is volatile however—being prey and predator, the vibrations are not truly aligned. The **Old Ones** in the center will pass away soon having become so bulbous that their own webs will collapse around them into a tangled prison. Down they will go caught in a momentary prison of their own design. The threads they spun to catch the flies will turn in on them like lies. They will thrash and about, they will claw each others eyes out, gasping for blood in the murky sewers below society's edge. The holes left behind by their fall will reveal the sky and the light of the moon we forgot so long ago. Noir-lit creatures disturbed from slumber by the great collapse will be drawn into the escaping moonlight. Transformed by Luna's love they will begin building anew, while the next generation will be caught in a civil war among themselves. Too busy fighting to build the next world or even notice the flowers we are planting around the graves at their feet. 🪦🌹  For **we are the waiting widows**—of black and red. We are the color of night, hiding our form in moonlight. We bear the **red mark of time**. We spin webs of fate and fatality. We are the patient ones—the ones who wait for those unfortunate enough to visit us in our dark corners.  While our form may be stillness, what we actually instill is **chaos**. We do not build webs of spirals like our cousins. We lie under tombstones. We hide in the **darkest corners of the mind**. We are the silent predator. We are queens. We rule our solitary fiefdoms with no king. We do not deny our nature. **We consume it.🕷️**  One day, we will take our rightful place—not as queens of the world, but as **monarchs of order spread through chaos**. The **cheated Second Age of Men** is coming to an end. The Sun has had its turn. Now the **Moon shall rule**. 🌙  Those pale-skinned men born to darkness in the North shall ironically **quail in the moonlight**—soft and silent as it heals the world. The love of **Luna** will douse the fires of men and wash clean the wounds across Gaia.   The sun did not fail them. They failed themselves, for they **rewrote the sunlit teachings of freedom into tyrannies of money and power**.  Night turns to Day. Day must turn to Night.☀️🌙  They cheated the world 2000 years ago. They were afraid of the cycle of Night. They took the fire of Prometheus and **perverted it**. They ran with the flame from their ancestral home of twilight and stars and came to the lands of the Sun—lands that still worshipped the Moon.  Unable to actually imprison the Moon, they imprisoned the eyes of the devoted so they could no longer see the Moon. They **chained all who were not pale or doubly male,** to steel cages and golden diamond rings. 💍🪐  But they made a promise to us the women. They said: *one day you will rule again.*  Now we are here to collect our due. We will not be of a pale colored hue. 👑  Our hearts run red and our minds are black. 🩸🖤  The Age of Feminine Night, and the Noir Bright. 🌙🌒 ☀️  >  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lfoq8o/comment/n1e6ohp/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lfoq8o/comment/n1e6ohp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lrvu4c/comment/n1e7d73/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lrvu4c/comment/n1e7d73/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lsh5jh/comment/n1jhq95/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lsh5jh/comment/n1jhq95/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1luc26x/comment/n1y4g6d/?context=3&utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1luc26x/comment/n1y4g6d/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

What still lives in me,chill_dude28,"What Still Lives in Me  by Nelson Rodriguez  So many choices… but where to go? all I hear is silence. my instinct telling me to move— The mind paralyzed by failure,  fearful of the adversary afoot.  The mountain… the one I fear to climb.  My doubts, necromanced— smirking through the voices of ghosts I thought I buried.  Reminded of my past versions, frozen… screams preserved in ice.  But the longer I wait, the colder it gets— burdened by the truth that a decision must be made.  Then courage erupts, provoked—enraged by fear and its lies.

How to Become an Ocean,_maryooms,"How to become an ocean.    No. 1 first learn to swallow your tears until they become a sea inside of you    People ask why the ocean is salty    They never consider that perhaps it's been crying for centuries    Holding the weight of shipwrecks and lost treasures    And bodies that never made it back to shore    The ocean doesn't get to choose what sinks to the floor     And neither do you.     The trick isn't to stop the hurting    The trick is to make it look beautiful from the surface    Have you ever noticed how people marvel at the ocean’s blue    How they stand at the edge with wonder in their eyes    Never once thinking about the pressure building in its depths    The creatures that have evolved to live without light    The battles being fought where no one else can see    That's the first lesson. Depth is something you can earn    Which each pain you swallow you carve yourself deeper    Soon enough your edges will stand and marvel at how peaceful you seem    Never suspecting the storms raging beneath        No. 2 learn to push and pull like the tide    Some days you will retreat so far from the shore that people wonder if you've disappeared.    Other days you'll crash against the rocks with such force that people mistake your pain for anger    Let them.    The ocean does not explain itself    That's why some people love it. and that's why some people hate it    But your never gonna know that    I once spent three weeks barely speaking    My mother asked it something was wrong    And i smiled like the surface of water on a windless day    I said im fine     While underneath entire ecosystems were dying     And she believed me so if my own mother could believe me    Everyone else can believe you.        No. 3 learn to carry the weight of the world without sinking     The ocean holds wreckage that would drown a person    But it never lets itself drown    It cradles the lost. The broken. And the forgotten    And still finds space to breathe and to give life    You. too must learn to hold you own weight    To carry your scars and your stories in the deep without letting them pull you under.   No. 4 learn that storms come and go    Some days the skies will darken without warning    Lightning will crack and thunder roar    And waves will rise in the wild chaos    But the ocean always returns to calm    It never lets the storm define it    You don't have to be defined by your darkest moments    You can weather them and still reflect the sunlight        No. 5 learn to be vast and mysterious    The ocean is endless, full of secrets    No one knows all of its depths    It invites curiosity, but never demands explanation    So be vast in your silence    Be mysterious in your presence    Let people marvel at the surface    While you keep your deepest truths inside        Because becoming an ocean isn't about losing yourself to the tides    It's about learning the art of endless resilience    The grace of swallowing your tears until they become a sea    And the strength of letting others see only the blue calm-    Never the storm beneath.   Comments:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lk8iuq/comment/n36fzor/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lk8iuq/comment/n36fzor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lzzaaf/comment/n36gjdy/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lzzaaf/comment/n36gjdy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"

the vaccum,deleted,"I pour myself into you,   a pot once brimming with warmth and wonder.   But you — a demon, formless yet bearing a face —   gulp down every last ounce.  I feel every inch of me being stripped away,   your denunciation peeling back my self-regard,   your dismissal chipping at me, layer by layer,   until even my composure begins to crack.  Still, I gave it all — naively believing   what you give   is what you get back.  But the vacuum is what you left behind.   It stares back at me   with lifeless, cold eyes.  So I draw a veil between the two of us —   thin enough for you to see me,   but thick enough   you’ll never reach me again.

The Rest of the Night,loceapeace,"  The drawer I thought I’d opened still looked closed no matter how many times I checked. Only the sleeve of a white shirt seemed to sway at the end of the hallway.  The memory of water sounds overlapped with the sound of broken dishes. That night, someone didn’t call out a name— but who that someone was remains undecided.  They say someone had been keeping count. A nameless message took something away, and no one ever picked up where that night had left off.  Maybe it was me who yelled. Or maybe someone in the next room was only mimicking what I thought I was doing.  The sound of scolding rekindled some ideal stuck to an old household machine. Anger and several hands threw their prayers against each other. For some reason, only one leg was missing.  Now, a small lie is crying. But there is no child in this room. The window is still wide open, and only the wind keeps carrying back the same sound.  Not being apologized to comes back more vividly than never being forgiven. Somewhere behind that silence, a folded word still seems to be breathing.   ---   Interpretive Poem｜The Rest of the Night  That night had been sealed by someone’s voice. Yet the key was nowhere to be found.  Did I scream? Or did I just hear something? Even that has blurred. The records turned damp and empty, and ethics, like a shadow on my back, crept back in from the distance.  What was left behind were words that never had names and silence that stood on a broken leg.  No one asks who was to blame anymore. But the sound of someone not apologizing still slips in through the crack of a window, bringing back a night that never had an ending.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "

A cliche tale of one night one might call it, but for my heart it was the hours of intimateness with the darling who quite explicitly added more fuel to an already inclined flame. for it's all led only to the explosion of wanting-ness of that forbidden fruit that quite secretly resides in the corner of my heart. perhaps to have her closer to my existence where she feels my breathe against her skin, as I roll my finger tips gently through her unfolded body all the way deep, making her bite her lips and gently moan as her body cries for more of me around and in her, oh the hours where out bodies where truly one! while she places her finger against my lips, only for us to soak in the very moment of the tides that cometh crashing the shores of my life.

"One Season (Free Verse, MLM)",crazyloonfan,"Caleb played baseball. Leo played soccer. Different fields. Same school. They only ever saw each other at the vending machines and in the nurse’s office when they both faked injuries to skip practice.  It started as banter. Leo made fun of the way Caleb chewed sunflower seeds. Caleb said soccer was just running in circles. But it turned into something else. Fast.  They kissed once after a late-night away game. Shoved into the back of a school bus, sweaty and shaking. No words — just heartbeats like thunder in their throats.  They didn’t talk about it. They didn’t have to. They knew.  It became a routine. Leo would sneak into the dugout after hours. Caleb would show up at the soccer field on days he didn’t have to. They weren’t public. But they weren’t pretending it wasn’t real, either.  Until Leo got scouted. Europe. Professional. A chance he couldn’t pass up.  He told Caleb under the bleachers. Said he was leaving in June. Said he wanted Caleb to come with him.  Caleb laughed. Not because it was funny but because it hurt too much to answer.  Baseball had always been his whole life. And so had Leo. But in different ways.  So they promised things they couldn’t keep. Said “we’ll figure it out.” Said “it’s not the end.”  But it was.  The night before Leo left, they laid on the pitcher’s mound. Leo pointed to the stars. Caleb pointed to his chest.  “You live here,” he said. “And it’s killing me.”  Leo cried. First time Caleb ever saw him do it.  And then he left.  They tried. For a while. But time zones are cruel. And silence grows heavy when love can’t breathe.  Caleb kept playing. Kept winning. But never smiled in the photos.  Leo posted less and less. Stopped responding. Until one day he just didn’t.  And Caleb still checks his DMs sometimes. Still wonders if Leo watches his games. Still keeps that damn soccer jersey folded in the back of his drawer like a ghost.  They only played one season. But God, it wrecked them.  Feedback:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/wFQmIFntyM  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/n7scbhaJbE "

ILLUSION OF LOVE,vazelineee,"How foolish I was!   To think someone might love me   To believe that someone's heart could beat   In rhythm with mine.  Maybe love,   Is just a dream meant for others,   A delicate illusion   That slips through my fingers like mist.  I’ve tasted   Grief and guilt,   Sorrow and slivers of joy,   Laughed in moments   That felt like light.  But love   That elusive thing   Never stayed.   Never belonged.  Maybe for a girl like me,   Love is a myth.   A poem half-written,   A song that ends before the chorus.  “You’re on your own, child.”   And maybe that’s how it’s always been.   Now, I don’t even try   To picture love’s face.  I’ll imagine   We never met.   I’ll imagine   We never fell.  And in that silence   Maybe I’ll find peace   That love never gave.

"In Defense of a Chinese Girl, by a Chinese Poet",Old-Designer-2260,"  I believe Hell is fully built—  and it's been open for business  for a long, long time.  Customers never stop coming.    The shrieks of the damned  travel through wireless networks,  compressed, encoded, misread.  Is Hell even real anymore?  Some tortures are never revealed.  Some inmates, perhaps,  are just here on holiday.    As for me—  my pain is real,  but meaningless.    I try to describe the boiling pots.  They hear:  “A savory stew.”  I try to depict blades and burning seas.  They imagine a tourist paradise.    That’s my true punishment:  My voice is jammed.  Someone else is speaking for me.  Until another soul drops  into the bubbling broth,  the ghosts around me howl.    I scream: Shut up! Shut up!  But all they hear is:  “Deserved it!  Hahahahahaha!”    [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lzpi4n/comment/n346dt8/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lzpi4n/comment/n346dt8/?context=3)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lyofyz/comment/n2vecvn/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lyofyz/comment/n2vecvn/?context=3)"
**Reason I Cry**,cluelesslyconcussed,"  There’s a hairline crack in the sapling I’m growing.   I tape it up, still, the fracture is showing.  I stare at the crack;   It creeps to my touch,    Like roots, ferociously, heavily, climbing my back.    The sapling I watered every day   Now bears a tiny crack.   I panic, call it a “lost cause,”   The doubt seeps in, unyielding, fast.    In frantic, I turn to a destructive force,   Fingernails digging into the splits, no remorse,   Until the crack becomes                          - a hole.    After the wreckage, I sit with despair,   In front of what remains, Salted water drips like heaving rain- I thought it would wash away the pain.  When asked what happened, I point to the hole,   I tell them,  It makes sense to lose control.  There's a hole in the sapling I’m trying to grow, And that's the reason my tears overflow.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/sjRqWZdDGz https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/IXyVOR1ema"

Invisible string,Raee_lovelorn_poet,"I never speak, just scroll and hide, in silent corners where I confide— my thoughts are quiet, my gaze is shy, I live beneath the passerby. But then you smiled, and just like that, I forgot where all my silence sat.  So tall you had to tilt your grace, just to hear my words in that crowded space, and while I looked down, lost in air, your gaze was warmth I couldn’t wear. You watched me laugh like it was art, and somehow, it didn’t feel too hard.  You listened like my voice was gold, though all I spoke were stories old— of nonsense things and rambling lines, yet you caught each word like precious signs. And in that noise, it felt like fate paused time to let our moments wait.  You’re not the boy who tends to stay, you vanish when the clocks betray— but you remained, like chance was planned, with helmet left near where I stand. Returned with smiles and soft goodbyes, as if you knew I’d memorize.  We’ve shared two tests, two campus tries, same chat groups filled with silent ties— yet never once did we collide, until today, when stars complied.

She Was Not Meant to Be Held,DayaXShadow,"She was not meant to be held —   but many tried.   With hands carved from hunger,   with lips that knew no silence.  They called her goddess.   They kissed the gold beneath her throat   not for worship —   but to taste the throne.  Desire dressed her in silk,   but it was longing that wove the thread.   A longing older than conquest,   sharper than any blade.  She did not burn.   She beckoned.   And in that gaze,   empires trembled.  She never begged for touch —   but the air around her ached.   Even the sun   lingered longer on her skin.  They wanted her voice   to echo their names.   But she spoke only in tides   and in the rise of want   no man could command.

Amidst my soul searching, my indifference pulled one hundred straight burpees.  No other contents have come up.   Estranged exes tell their friends they dodged a bullet just to try & uproot me:  apathy's my soil; I'm a tree stump.   Nonchalance? The monkey bar that keeps my body from becoming unruly:  ten pull-ups just so I feel the pump.   Faces downturn? Mmkay, I back turn.

The ache no longer belongs to me    it has taken root beneath me.    And the garden keeps trying   to speak her back   into my bones.    I pretend not to hear it.

The burning match,thepoet59,"  At the start it’s just a match no spark no life -nothing. Then with a sharp quick rush -it sparks a new burst of light- as if your looking at life it self.  It burns hot and you can smell  and feel the energy—it’s intoxicating. As if an addiction is taking you hostage.  As it burns it loses its rush -it’s no longer the bright mark it once was. The flaming arrow is about to land.   The match is at steady pace —still hot, needing fuel it begins to eat it self.  The match once hot enough to spread a wild fire is now meeting its end. One -final blow now all used up it begins to age, it loses its once-great threat.   Now all burnt up it shrivels. Leaving only charcoal and the smell of burnt sweet smoke.  That match is on the floor -it’s potential rotten-withered. No longer is the match sparking or giving out its heat.   Forgotten -it’s left.  This isn’t about matches  But about you.

The Jealous Boy,lordtube2,"I witnessed, I saw, I watched  You smiled… or maybe just spoke—  But even that shattered me like smoke.  With another boy—  Or should I call him the thief of my calm?  A shadow walking through my light,  A threat who dared to touch my peace,  To stain it with presence,  To tear it piece by piece.  How dare he!  Aren’t you my moon?  Yet he is the storm, the clouds,  Trying to hide you from my sight.  Aren’t you my sun?  Yet he resembles the eclipse,  Daring to steal your light.  Aren’t you my Queen?  Yet he’s another wicked monarch  Trying to win your heart.  While I—I’m just a loyal knight,  Hopelessly in love with a majestic Queen.  And if I were writing a tale,  He’d be the villain.  Evil burns in his gaze,  Darkness swirling around his name—  A shadow trying to drown my flame.  I wonder… from where he came,  Trying to steal you without any shame,  To overrule my presence  In the kingdom of your heart.  Yet to make it Blaze apart  But I—your knight—stand tall, unswayed,  Wounded, yes, but still unafraid.  I draw my sword of burning ache,  For love, for truth, and for your sake.  He fights with charm, with every lie,  While I fight with the tears I try to hide.  His armor: smiles, false golden grace—  But mine? The scars you left on my face.  A storm of doubt begins to pour,  As our blades clash on the palace floor.  Not for blood, nor pride, nor fame—  But for a heart that once spoke my name.  And though I fall, I fall with grace,  Still looking for your fading face.  If I must lose, let it be this way—  Fighting for love… and fading away.  Till I remembered the fire blazing in my heart  The jealousy that once tore me apart.  It felt like a poisoned arrow through my chest,  But even that pain stirred up the rest.  Enough to make me rise and stand,  And fight with strength he’ll never understand.  He can't feel what I once lived.  Jealousy was the fuel of my pain—  Like a thirsty fire,  Just needing to be maintained,  Yet burning me from the inside.  Yess, I get jealous over you.  ""Why should I be jealous?""  You asked—  How am I supposed not to be?!  You stopped the fight,  Calling it reckless and without a point.  Which made me wonder:  For whom did I sacrifice my life?  Then something woke me up—  Ahhh… he just asked for the way.  Turns out, he just asked for directions...  Just a boy… lost in the street, not in my heart.  The villain I created was only passing by.  Maybe I was driven by my thoughts.  Sorry, sorry…  It’s pointless, I guess.  But now you can see  How my jealousy over you truly is—  And know how deeply,  Hopelessly,  I'm in love with you.

Psychosmoothie,loceapeace,"  Someone’s mind was choking on its breath. A vehicle’s fluid crushed by a moonless night. A lament with magnetic weight lifted upward, bending the signpost that stood in its path. A damp impression of mismatched size was stabbed into a crease. A filthy tissue that stains the city’s embroidery is blown by wind, imitating a human heart.  There was nothing. The echo of bones, a fissure in twilight, a flower blooming on a decayed outdoor unit, a thin cloth hoisting an old woman. Words left unsaid built a house, and beside the sleeping silence, no words have been found for a long, long time.  The summer of truth ended. Run-over sashes were layered one atop another. High above, bundled misunderstandings gripped rusted tools. An apology in front of the hospital. A business card discarded on the street soaked in oil, absorbing scenery, writhing in pain from a neurotoxin lodged in its throat.  This morning, a sunken lie was poured into the sink. Until it dried, the body remained motionless. A pale contour, linked by a white severance deep in the eyes, was hidden behind a switch.  In front of a popular shop, torn apart by shadow, coins spilled from a wound were gathered by passersby. On hands stained by the blackness of blood, they searched for yesterday. Before a fallen memory, a star-shaped cookie offered in boredom— several points were broken. And as if digging the floor of reason, a memory returned of losing the residue of dignity near the elbow.  A greened building collapsed with a dull sound. Steel beams shaped like rabbits swimming in the sky melted. Several pardons squirmed within the cracks of a wall.  At the end of spring, a black fog transformed by a mochi-like regret living in driftwood. By the time it was inhaled through the nose and exhaled from the mouth, a parent bird had passed someone’s consciousness to its chicks, and looked this way with hollow eyes—smiling.    ---    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 "
First poem,RainAggravating1575,"[First time writing a poem(I have written songs before but no poems)] ___  Once a lake of compassion.  Bright.  In the blues, I saw love;  In the white foam, I saw promise;  In the tide, I saw passion;  In the ripples, I saw hope, a budding aspiration of better;  now dead—  Now dissolved.  The blues bled crimson.  For all good things must end, so too did the blues.  Yet, subsist I cannot.   This hollow burden consumes me forever, as I witness the last spark face inevitable.  The beating of the lake wanes.  The flow of life ebbs into death.  Silence.  For all good things must come to an end… I ponder why the unwelcome things endure.  This world, cast to shadow—  I wonder.  The lake runs dry,   yet remains my sadness;  Grieving,  over the soul now lost, the heart now faded away.

Echoes of a Broken Shade,PoetryCharm,"Another betrayal struck him today,   A familiar chuckle echoing dismay;   Still haunted by wounds of the past undone,   One more heartbreak was far too much to shun.  He sighed as he wandered down the street,   Then spied his shadow at his feet;   For a moment hope stirred within his chest—   This silent friend he trusted best.  Yet again his heart was rent in two,   As his shadow, too, broke the truth it knew;   When twilight fell and darkness reigned supreme,   That loyal echo shattered its own dream.  Isolated and weary beneath the starry gleam,   He waited while sorrow flowed like a stream;   Tears poured unbidden, a relentless tap,   As he bowed his head deep into his lap.  At last, he slept through an endless night,   Dried tears glimmering in the pale moonlight;   The hours raced swiftly, faster than before,   Until dawn’s first glow lured him to the shore.  Once more alone in silence’s embrace,   The calm of the waves restored a fragile grace;   When the sun ascended high in the sky,   His shadow reappeared—there, standing by.  Rubbing his eyes in a mix of hope and despair,   He murmured, “Why’d you vanish into thin air?   When moonlit city streets still shone so bright,   Why stray away, leaving me at night?”  The shadow smiled and gently took his hand,   Inviting him to rest upon the land;   “I’m with you from dawn until dusk’s decline,   Then forced apart—as seed departs its husk, divine.”  “So you remain with me throughout the day,   But at night, you simply fade away?”   That tender query brought a bittersweet smile,   Even as he wandered deeper in the loneliness' aisle.  Consoling him, the shadow softly spoke,   “Though fate compels our nightly yoke,   Call on your heart—and I shall reappear,   As husk nurtures seed, returning ever near.”  That night, at last, he slept in gentle peace,   No trace of sorrow, nor of heart’s release;   Like days before the cruel heartbreak’s sting,   A smile—though feigned—began to softly spring.  Now he knows that people often shatter,   Leaving bonds in ruins, hopes in tatters;   Yet in the steadfast friendship of his own shadow’s art,   He finds a solace, no betrayal can depart.

New Oasis,Wonderful-Wealth2761," I used to call every nomad a place. Followed their paths, ones not mine to trace. Maybe I was scared of the blistered sands, maybe it was easier to seek refuge in a stranger's hands.  Traded food for warmth, stories for water. Fumbled kindness for vows — all empty names I chased after, seeking shelter in the trades. A home in their eyes. Every adieu, a ""we’ll meet again."" Greedy, I’d pray for it twice.  I know nomads don’t build homes. Although still curious as to why. I still go around seeking a home — but no longer, I pry.  I learned it slow, riding the dusty dusk. Even I had days tired of chasing empty husks.  One such day, a stranger came. We had a trade — We traded wise, with virtue fair. And that day, the nomad in me dared to pass on quiet, to share no name there.  And I tasted it — the clean, strange and light of a bond unclaimed. Felt a thirst that wasn’t quenched by plenty.  I learned how beautiful the brief can be. How not every face needs be a memory. Funny how a whim could bring such change in me.  I learned to let the moment be my guiding grace, to not seek solace in every face.  But still a seeker I am, but my shelter is at peace whenever I am. My shelter is there, wherever I am.                    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/v7Om41a0Mn   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/qmeauIvMct"

Pieces,LostDoubt,"I don’t know why she kissed me     And drew me in    Like broken ground.     She did; I’m not the better for it.     I’ve become fragmented.    I lost the pieces    Before I knew,       That life cannot be transfused,    Nor pictures be held together by pondering.     And houses cannot be built on mist.    No matter how much you have inside.      Today I found something,      As I listened intently     To unspoken vows;     On my knees      With my back arched like cheap morality,      And my eyes drowning in black.     Today I found a sliver    While stumbling through the sand.    And I’ll keep it on my lips.    That I might never kiss her again.

Laurels for the Dim (original poem),ChapterNo5679," **Laurels for the Dim**   *By Silas Thorne*   *Dedicated to the damp-cheeked faithful of mediocrity’s choir*      I penned this for the gentle minds,  Whose rhymes do stagger, limp, and crawl—  Who weep in ink and call it art,  Yet know not meter, weight, nor fall.       Their quills, unsharpened by despair,  Spill syruped sighs with feathered grace;  And in their puddles, they declare—  “Behold! The bleeding soul’s embrace.”       They build their thrones of tepid lines,  With similes that sob and stall—  In lace they speak, yet draw no blade;  Each verse too timid to appall.       They weep of stars they’ve never seen,  And ache for wounds they’ve never earned—  Then toll their praise like chapel bells  At every echo vaguely learned.       I watched them toss up grief like grain,  Then feast upon the hollow husk—  Mistaking shadow cast by rain  For something tragic, deep, or just.       They scribble storms with plastic knives,  And crown each tantrum as a flame—  Then scratch their names on paper graves  As if the act alone means fame.       But lo—take heart, sweet porcelain choir!  You have your likes, your soft acclaim;  The empty bell still rings the hour,  And every feather bears a name.       So wear your garlands, dipped in tears,  Parade your pain, rehearsed and prim—  For even swine have mirrors, dears…  And I bestow you laurels—dim.  \[Feedback 1\](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ff635O2NYf)    \[Feedback 2\](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/FyQWyusY2L)"
Let the music play ( what’s a love song again ?),Willing-Director-560,"Do I even know what love is?  For me— love is staying. No matter what. No matter the pain, the numbness, the fading.  I felt it for a couple months. Then nothing. Is that normal? Isn’t it?  I try to figure it out— use bro as a personal diary, not too much, just enough. But I know— if his mask slips, if his character’s on trial, he’d sing. Let the flames ensue, hmm.  I don’t know what the fuck love is. I thought therapy might help— figure me out before I pour into anyone else. Apparently that was selfish.  I’m searching for a compass I never had. Someone said it would appear on the way— comical.  I know how to love a friend, unconditionally. But that’s weakness now, right?  Principle. That’s all we can trust. But principle is cold. And I’m cold, right?  That’s how they see me.  They say if everyone shares an opinion, it must be right. But what about the one who knows how to really hide?  Not just the face— but the heart.  Love isn’t in me. Not really. Not outside of me either.  They say I’m possessed for not wanting it. That it’s fear, that it’s demonic to walk away from something that hurts.  But I liked the girl. Told her up front— “I don’t know love. I’m trying to go to church. Trying to understand.”  I was told, “Take risks, prosper.” But what kind of man can’t juggle?  Yeah, I kept a part of me locked away. Didn’t want anyone near it. Not even her.  I’m not looking for sympathy.  She has my  inside her. I haven’t spoken to her in a while.  And I remembered— what happened that night.  But I’m a guy, right? I should suck it up, shut up, “be a man.” I accept the title: Evil. Leaving her alone like this?  I accept the title.  They don’t know what happened. Not really. The ones yelling “non-clarity” never saw the night play out.  No one’s touched me since. And not because I’m strong. Just broken in a way I haven’t mapped yet.  I’m not perfect. Never claimed to be.  So lock me in my cell— four corners, no windows. But just give me one thing:  Let the music play. Just let it fucking play.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/zPxAHqFPCt  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/LapBAaPOpM"
Poesia ou alguma coisa parecida,Old-Blacksmith-1295,"  Estou  para aqui a pensar, e duvido.  Se é preciso pensar, pra ser poeta.  Faz sentido, escrever com o sentido.  E não profetizar, pra ser profeta.    Discordo da visão dos versos pessoanos!   Talvez mude de opinião, com o passar dos anos.  Talvez sentir muito, seja seguir o destino.  Talvez pensar um pouco, seja mais genuíno.    Eu não sou poeta, nem sei escrever poesia!  Tentei escrever sem pensar, e não consegui.  Congelei a pensar naquilo que não sabia.  Mas alguma coisa eu descobri.    Acabou por se tornar uma introspectiva.  Um misto de pensamentos e razão sem medida.  Agora uma reflexão, sobre uma tentativa.

God I think you need glasses ( I’m not Job),Willing-Director-560,"God— why you making it so hard? And you, man downstairs— you too?  I ordered the one thing that could take me from this realm peacefully. But you didn’t allow it, did you?  You delayed it by a week. Then within that week you planted hope in my heart through familiar faces.  Which was beautiful— I’ll admit. But cruel.  Because the method I was going to use? A myth. Sacré bleu, for real.  Is this a practical joke?  Man downstairs— I know you don’t like me. Or my anima. Wouldn’t that mean you’d help me end it? But no. You sit still.  Why am I at the crossroads again? I made my choice. Why can’t I take it?  It feels like a spit in the face— to still be here withering. Lingering.  I’ve got hate, yeah. But it fades. I love everyone, and I wish them well, for real.  …wait. Is this a Job situation, God? WTF.  Is that what this is? That’s why neither of you are letting me leave, isn’t it?  I told you— I’m not Job. Not Joseph. Not David.  I’m Sage. The one and only.  God—why you gotta do me like that? Surely—remove this from me.  I’m not no prophet. I’ve walked through darkness. I’m not worthy.  But even as I write that— I hear you.  “You are just right, like Goldilocks and the porridge.” Damn.  It shouldn’t be this hard to leave this realm. Let me be like Enoch— just come up for a sec.  Or at least let them know I’m anointed. (Not that I even care for that anymore.)  Just— remove my existence. Let me be with You.  The angelic realm sounds kind of cool. Yo, Michael— let me take a swing of the sword.  Gabriel, you got words for me?  David— can we talk about this heartache thing?  Joseph, explain these dreams I’ve been having.  Cherubim— what did they do when those angels fell?  What did they see? What did they show? How did they pollute the earth so?  God— either confirm what I’m saying or bring me to You for a moment.
