A Puddle's Whisper,PappaSmurfXIV,"You fall into a puddle  of resentment and tears.  Your life’s being soaked  with all your worst fears.    Grasping at reality,  trying to make sense —  everything feels like a lie,  left in the dark, in suspense.    The puddle grows deeper,  love crumbles — you drown.  The water’s at your knees,  rising fast, pulling down.    The puddle starts to whisper;  you slowly become friends.  It hisses, “Be angry, lash out,”  but your conscience transcends.    Don’t become a victim  of the puddle’s abyss.  Stay true to your heart —  that’s where you’ll find bliss.    Your values are strong,  though the puddle is deep.  Just keep above water,  till you’re ready to leap.    You grab for the ledge,  pulling yourself free.  The puddle clings to your ankles —  but you kick, break, and breathe.    Overcome with emotion,  you let go — you’re free.  The puddle melts away,  and at last, you see:    No puddle’s too deep,  though it feels without end.  You’re stronger than you know —  all wounds can mend.

The Last Light,Potential-Walrus-885,"7 months have come and gone  Time to pack my bags and move on  I'll turn this last light off in the house  Close the door and build from the ground  Heartache isn't in me  Hasn't been in a while  You said, ""Ask, you never know""  But the question I would ask  I already know  You avoid any emotion  That comes with me  Because deep down  You know you miss me   So for you and me  I'll turn this last light off in the house  That way, I no longer hear the sound  Or see your face when I close my eyes  This final shift will be my final goodbye  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/djcaN5bNrB https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/nmV72tTC02","7 months have come and gone time to pack my bags and move on i'll turn this last light off in the house close the door and build from the ground heartache isn't in me hasn't been in a while you said, ""ask, you never know"" but the question i would ask i already know you avoid any emotion that comes with me because deep down you know you miss me so for you and me i'll turn this last light off in the house that way, i no longer hear the sound or see your face when i close my eyes this final shift will be my final goodbye"
While You Were in Japan,Dogdydaycare_,"You were already waking up as I was crying myself to sleep. 14 hours ahead, but somehow always behind in the things that mattered.  We called— but only when I asked. We texted— but only if I reached out first. And even then, your replies felt like I was pulling teeth from a ghost who used to hold me like I was the only thing real.  I thought the time difference was the reason. I excused it with jet lag, with classes, with culture shock. But I couldn’t ignore how I was always the one trying to close the distance while you let it grow.  Back home, I sat with your brothers— watched them love so loudly. How they planned little things, called their partners “my girl,” smiled when their phones lit up. I saw what it looked like when someone *wanted* to be wanted.  They told me we were great together. Said they hoped it would work. But then they looked at me— at the way I poured myself into you with wide eyes and open hands, and at how you kept yourself tucked away, like a secret I wasn’t meant to know fully.  They noticed how I was the sunshine in a room you never let light in. How I talked about you like a poem I was proud to write, and you barely said a word about me even before you left.  And maybe the worst part is that I *knew* this. Deep down, I felt it— every time I reread our texts hoping to find something that felt like trying.  But I kept going. Because you held me after someone else broke me, and I confused that for love. I thought anyone willing to stay with all my damage must mean it.  I didn’t want to believe that you liked the idea of me more than the day-to-day of loving me.  But I see it now.  I wasn’t asking for too much. I was asking the wrong person.

Lost Girl,QueenofGreen79,"Nobody knows about the girl who sits alone in the dark.  She's sad and alone, but playing her part.  Day after day, each as empty as the last.   A husband who's long lost interest.  A grown son who could not care less.   She's surrounded by them, but never more alone and unseen.  Missing and craving the most simplest of things.  She's mastered putting on a show, happiness so easily portrayed.  Deeper into the darkness she goes.  She's the girl that nobody knows, and the one that nobody sees.  ___________________________________________ https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7QyMvxJ9vx  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/1MMRObr1hk","nobody knows about the girl who sits alone in the dark. she's sad and alone, but playing her part. day after day, each as empty as the last. a husband who's long lost interest. a grown son who could not care less. she's surrounded by them, but never more alone and unseen. missing and craving the most simplest of things. she's mastered putting on a show, happiness so easily portrayed. deeper into the darkness she goes. she's the girl that nobody knows, and the one that nobody sees."

Babies crawl, learning touch is love,  feeling what words can’t really speak of.   They don’t talk much, they read by feel,  what’s held, what’s lost, and which cuts heal.   and If you stay too long, you might forget—  that to show, is how to speak   Till your face is just hands,   feeling round in the dark,  reaching and looking,   just trying to spark.     ₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩₩  I refuse to elaborate.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/WozOcBWxsB  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NKkrGIXmVC","i don't know, but ive heard it been said, theres an island where the people all have fingers for heads. no eyes to see, no mouths to say, they only know when they touch- not to play. they press their hands, onto fire and stone, to feel the pain, and to make it known. babies crawl, learning touch is love, feeling what words can't really speak of. they don't talk much, they read by feel, what's held, what's lost, and which cuts heal. and if you stay too long, you might forget that to show, is how to speak till your face is just hands, feeling round in the dark, reaching and looking, just trying to spark. i refuse to elaborate."

Bedroom: my first poem 07/23,AffectionateLand9084,"The air is covering my mind.   I’ve stitched my emotions into the bedsheets,   using a pattern I hoped to make a new reality.   Now I cry waiting for someone to save me.   Why does no one hear me?   Of course, my words never touch my lips;  it’s much too lonely to speak, to let someone in.    I live in others.  In their grief, body.   I live in their love and death,   their war that splits my obsolete body in two.   Tell me stories;   let my bedsheets drip in vehemence   Let me soak in sentiments that I can live within.    The overhead ceiling fan spins my fanaticism,   my depraved convictions drown me   in the walls of my bedroom.   The dust gathers as an homage to long-forgotten fears   in the windows of my boredom.    I know not much, though I manipulate oxygen   to breathe a little easier,   to feel my mortality under gods of solitude.   Lay next to me and let me cover you in my allegories;   after all, I cannot speak.   Let the flickering lightbulb I’ve yet to change submerge   you.

Out of Order Oubliette,zyerhod1,"**Out of Order Oubliette**   *by Bryon Slack*  In my youthful vanity,   not yet confronted   by the face of Time   that takes,   I boasted of an oubliette   in my soul—   where I could bury   any secret,   or toss away   any suffering   into an endless abyss   and be meaningless.  I discarded the detritus   of the day to day—   here a brick,   there a stone,   perhaps a sonnet or two   on the flaws   in my character.  Housefuls of soil   were shoveled in   with barely a thought.   I could take it all—   no pain I couldn't   make drop.  Years have a way   of making liars   of our bravest declarations.  The pit I had praised   as proof of strength   was only a waiting silence,   compressed into shape.  And so it was—   hand over hand,   thrown over shoulder   with never a glance—   until the first brick   clattered back out   of the buried vault   of malcontent.  I had nowhere left to put it.  The fire began to smolder   in my veins, crimson   edges began framing my vision.   The shackled form   of my father's memory   began to howl in laughter—   that I was always bound   to be him—   from his cell deep within   the iron corridors   of my mind.  And I knew then—   what I’d built was no oubliette,   but a vault with pressure doors—   and somewhere, something   had finally cracked.       **Feedback:**   [""When the Ticking Gets Louder""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1me8ump/comment/n67l8fq/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""After the Storm""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mdkvf4/comment/n62keqg/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   ","by bryon slack in my youthful vanity, not yet confronted by the face of time that takes, i boasted of an oubliette in my soul where i could bury any secret, or toss away any suffering into an endless abyss and be meaningless. i discarded the detritus of the day to day here a brick, there a stone, perhaps a sonnet or two on the flaws in my character. housefuls of soil were shoveled in with barely a thought. i could take it all no pain i couldn't make drop. years have a way of making liars of our bravest declarations. the pit i had praised as proof of strength was only a waiting silence, compressed into shape. and so it was hand over hand, thrown over shoulder with never a glance until the first brick clattered back out of the buried vault of malcontent. i had nowhere left to put it. the fire began to smolder in my veins, crimson edges began framing my vision. the shackled form of my father's memory began to howl in laughter that i was always bound to be him from his cell deep within the iron corridors of my mind. and i knew then what i'd built was no oubliette, but a vault with pressure doors and somewhere, something had finally cracked.

Blow and Handshake,loceapeace,"  The stain on the floor resembled a question, left untouched, fading out. Boxed-in air stifled a laugh, invisible rules lost shape, and pain—adrift outside—forgot its meaning.  Along a corridor meant only for passing, the sound of torn cuffs rang oddly sincere. Heels stepped down out of habit, dragging a sound that never fully arrived. Footsteps slipped into silence as everyone competed to perfect the act of not noticing. Among them, who was it that won the game of not looking?  Everyone whispered “I didn’t see” as if in prayer, lips folding contradiction with a straight face. Only my anger held heat. Why should silence still earn forgiveness?  Inside a sealed theater, a voice refusing its role posed the question: who, here, is mad? When the question faded and clung to the wall, the wall, unusually gentle, accepted it. Only the air that observed remained calm, untouched by madness.  Where running was no longer an option, my feet stopped for no reason. The exit was sealed— yet a stain in the book’s margin remained free. And watching it, I felt no reason left to run.  Within an overwritten framework, the pain assigned to me was given without weight, and removed with even less. Only the question soaked into the floor, leaving behind no voice, only the trace of its delay.  No one shared the pain. I stepped over the question for my own convenience. Convenience— always easy to notice in hindsight. A returning gaze stabbed me in the back. Who failed to see? Perhaps it isn’t the act, but the footprint that followed, that cannot be forgiven.  Beneath the desk, the boy’s name went unwritten. His anger, meaningless, dried quietly. There, a cold vacancy spread. The fist I threw caught only air— and I realized it was never a blow, but a handshake with nothing. The seat, still empty, warped its outline, and the pain that had no way to ask faded— not reaching anyone— vanishing, slowly.    ---   Interpretive Poem｜Blow and Handshake      What appears here is not a voice gone unheard, but a question never granted permission to speak.  The floor’s purpose was to cover the carcass of the question. The corridor— to rob escape of reason. Even the sound of shoes had no right to be sincere.  “I didn’t see” was recited not as prayer but as contradiction. When the question finally clung to the wall, it was the wall— not the speaker— that received it carefully.  This is where ethics broke. The blow and the handshake switched roles. Anger shook hands with air. The handshake became a perfected form of violence.  Pain was distributed without name, without origin. No one stole the voice— but all footprints stepped on the question. Everyone complicit. Everyone witness.  The boy’s name was erased. The empty seat grew larger. When his anger finally dried, no one asked what caused it.  The fist, once raised, grasped only silence. And in that moment, you, the reader, held the same question in your hands.  This poem offers no answers, no redemption. It is a blow shaped like a question, and a handshake shaped like silence.  It rejects your ethics. Slows your comprehension. Spirals just before you arrive.  So what you held— was not air. It was the question. Still trembling. Not yet gone.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 ","the stain on the floor resembled a question, left untouched, fading out. boxed-in air stifled a laugh, invisible rules lost shape, and painadrift outsideforgot its meaning. along a corridor meant only for passing, the sound of torn cuffs rang oddly sincere. heels stepped down out of habit, dragging a sound that never fully arrived. footsteps slipped into silence as everyone competed to perfect the act of not noticing. among them, who was it that won the game of not looking? everyone whispered ""i didn't see"" as if in prayer, lips folding contradiction with a straight face. only my anger held heat. why should silence still earn forgiveness? inside a sealed theater, a voice refusing its role posed the question who, here, is mad? when the question faded and clung to the wall, the wall, unusually gentle, accepted it. only the air that observed remained calm, untouched by madness. where running was no longer an option, my feet stopped for no reason. the exit was sealed yet a stain in the book's margin remained free. and watching it, i felt no reason left to run. within an overwritten framework, the pain assigned to me was given without weight, and removed with even less. only the question soaked into the floor, leaving behind no voice, only the trace of its delay. no one shared the pain. i stepped over the question for my own convenience. convenience always easy to notice in hindsight. a returning gaze stabbed me in the back. who failed to see? perhaps it isn't the act, but the footprint that followed, that cannot be forgiven. beneath the desk, the boy's name went unwritten. his anger, meaningless, dried quietly. there, a cold vacancy spread. the fist i threw caught only air and i realized it was never a blow, but a handshake with nothing. the seat, still empty, warped its outline, and the pain that had no way to ask faded not reaching anyone vanishing, slowly. --- interpretive poemblow and handshake what appears here is not a voice gone unheard, but a question never granted permission to speak. the floor's purpose was to cover the carcass of the question. the corridor to rob escape of reason. even the sound of shoes had no right to be sincere.

Poem about cheating and feeling like a victim of myself,BellAppropriate7836,"I never wanted all these sexual things, and still they destroyed the one true love I had. It feels like a drug – a drug I’m not addicted to, but many people on Earth are. And the Devil searched for this drug in me, but I didn’t refuse to give it to him, so it’s still my fault. Because you should only give it to people you love. Some people love and some people hate this drug. I hate it so much, because every time I give it to somebody, I feel like the love disappears. But the night when I gave it to the Devil, there was no love between me and him – but between me and my only true love – and so that love disappeared that night. I gave the drug to the Devil and paid the consequences, even though I hate to give the drug – so I just got double the pain. And the worst thing is: once you give the drug to somebody, it can’t be returned. That decision stays with you till you die, including the consequences. I couldn’t say no. I wanted to, but I just didn’t know how to say the words. They’re so simple, but so hard to pronounce when I have to say them. I wish I could. And now I suffer – with the Devil forever a part of me.

A dead line is what was expected, Instead was hit with something different, A lifeline on the other side, Resounding sound that sent my heart a flutter, It rang—  Each chime growing louder  A sound I grieved like a ghost.  Ive made a thousand wrong turns, I finally see the flicker of headlights on the road,  Im chasing their glow, Hoping they lead me home.  The hourglass on the mantle froze midstream, Every ring echoing like a heartbeat my ears crave to hear, How long has it been my dear?  You picked up— My heart stopped— The earth stopped rotating, Like it knew how long I'd been waiting.  I rehearsed this moment in the mirror like a boy trying to be a man with something brave to say, Every line had to be perfect for you, But hearing that ringing again— Stage fright took my hand, Stole all the lines I had planned  Your voice broke down the dam, A river of memories comes rushing in— The park, The car, You and your guitar, Blueberry wine and laughter stained lips, Those Cinnamon Sunburst eyes and midnight drives, Chasing adventure under city lights.  Three hours went by, in a flash, Your voice was softer than I remember, Almost tired but still kind, You asked how I'd been— I wanted to hear about you, Still I nearly told you everything.  Maybe this is nothing, Just an echo of what once was But even an echo can carry some truth, And I heard it in your silence— You missed me too.

An Ode to the Fallen Artist,Confident-Beyond-139,"Can you separate the art from the artist?  I do not care.  .  That is the wrong question.   The better question is:  Did you ever separate the art from the artist?   .  Great art speaks to us.   For a moment, things are clear.  We love this clarity.  We rejoice in its reflection of life - perhaps a reflection of us.   And then, it's gone.  .  So, we cling to that moment of clarity, even as it fades.   That love turns to fear.   Terrified to move forward into the blurry.   we stay put  .  Their art becomes a numbing agent  A freeze frame of meaning.  We rejoice at their despair.   Their sickness, we call raw and authentic.   Their pain, we call enlightening.  .  We lock away our love.  Too painful to stare at the reflection.  We crave the blurry.  We create a caricature of their pain.  .  Are we captive to the whims of erratic artists,   or captors of an idealized manifestation of their torment?  .  The greatest triumph — and the ultimate blight — for an artist is to make it big.   Their art becomes immortal — and dead.  .  *And the artist?*  .  Cursed to go on tour and parade around a shred of who they once were.   Trapped between a will to create and longing to conform.   .  Can you separate the art from the artist?  We never wanted to.

Two in a dream,Ok_Manufacturer_195," Everywhere I look couples. Smiling. Perfect. Or so it seems.  I know storms rage behind closed doors, but still, I ache.  When will it be my turn to give someone a reason to glow? To share a glance, a kiss, a private universe of inside jokes?  I have become what I never dreamed the one alone, the wandering uncle, a ghost on the water.  Yet in every dream there are always two.  And some nights, I fear I will drift forever with no one to anchor me home.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/jwxvjFRMV8  https://www.reddit.com/r/Original_Poetry/s/HR34USo12W","everywhere i look couples. smiling. perfect. or so it seems. i know storms rage behind closed doors, but still, i ache. when will it be my turn to give someone a reason to glow? to share a glance, a kiss, a private universe of inside jokes? i have become what i never dreamed the one alone, the wandering uncle, a ghost on the water. yet in every dream there are always two. and some nights, i fear i will drift forever with no one to anchor me home."
The Snack Aisle Sermon,theliminalfox," *(Her POV)*  I went in for one thing.   Just one.      But the air conditioning hit different,   the fluorescent lights were too loud,   and the moment   I saw your favourite chocolate bar,   it started.      Then the drink you always reach for.   The crisps with the flavour   you said tastes like childhood.   The stupid lollies you pretend not to like   but always finish first.      I wasn’t even hungry.   I just… couldn’t choose.      Because everything felt a little like you   and none of it felt like enough.   So I bought it all.      No ceremony.   No explanation.   Just quietly lined them up   on the kitchen counter   like a confession   you weren’t supposed to see.      You didn’t say anything.   Just blinked once.   Then twice.   You let out a quiet chuckle,   the kind you didn’t know   you were holding   and smiled in that cute but crooked way   you do when you’ve been seen   too clearly.      I shrugged.   Said something dumb about indecision.      But the truth is?   This was never about snacks.      It was about knowing   what sweetness felt like   when I didn’t.      It was about memory   made edible.   It was about you,   and every small thing   you didn’t think   anyone noticed.      And now?   They’re all here.   In one ridiculous pile   because I couldn’t choose   just one way   to say   I missed you.  ---  **The Snack Altar Line-Up**   *(His POV)*  The kitchen smelled like cinnamon and summer rain   the late afternoon kind.   I hadn’t expected anyone to be home yet.      But there they were.   Stacked across the bench.   A lineup of snacks   with familiar colours,   silly fonts,   brightly coloured packaging   and the quiet weight   of being remembered.      My favourite drink.   The chocolate bar I joked about hoarding.   Those weird fruit chews   I only ever bought once   but apparently spoke volumes.      She didn’t say anything.   Just stood by the fridge,   shoulder angled,   like it wasn’t a big deal.      “I couldn’t decide,”   she said.      But I saw the care in the chaos.   The way each item wasn’t just a snack,   but a timestamp.   A signal.   A soft little mirror   of the version of me   I forgot could be loved like that.      I didn’t say thank you.   Didn’t know how to   without making it too much.      So I opened the chips   and handed them to her.      We smiled,   That was enough.      And maybe it was.      Because in that moment,   in that absurd, beautiful pile   of sweet and salty offerings,   I realised      she never needed   a reason   to remember me.      She just did.

In Threes,Acceptable_Link_6546,"#   My mother used to say   Death comes in threes,   black cars parading in a row,   lilies wilting, one by one.      After the first eulogy,   she would sit stiff,   scanning obituaries   for names she knew,   counting omens,   naming signs.      Superstition,   I was sure.      But then I heard the crow   tap on the windowpane,   once,   twice,   three times --      and suddenly,   counting made sense to me.      KNOCK.      Robin Williams,   man of a thousand voices,   a mind like a firecracker   bursting across the stage,   sparks exploding   like gears in overdrive,   thoughts faster   than his tongue could catch.      I grew up with his epic whirlwind,   that manic improv genius wit,   filling my living room.      We flew to Agrabah,   him as Genie,   all laughter, smoke and magic.      Mork,   Ms. Doubtfire,   Patch Adams --   he brought fire to them all   and more.       But the greatest mask he ever wore,   was his smile   in the midst of his storm.      His was the first suicide   that ever truly shocked me.   When my friend said he'd died,   I couldn't believe   that much magic could   vanish from this world.      Later, after the tears,   I wondered:   if he couldn't survive this life,   what hope was there for me?      KNOCK. KNOCK.      Chester Bennington,   screaming frontman   for every metal-emo 2000s kid,   howling through headphones,   bleeding out survival.      Linkin Park was a lifeline --   his white-knuckled grip on the mic   roaring battle cries to the masses.   Every note of crawling anguish   reminded us we were not alone.       Shadows spiraled   through his confessions,   spotlight anthems lit his grief.   We sung to the despair in those chords,   lyrics mirroring our own in harmony.   But screams echoed so loud   they drowned the warning signs.      He became so numb.      And we played   that shit on beach trips.      He stood   one step closer to the edge,   with wounds that would not heal   and we tossed his raw rage   onto workout playlists,   and at concerts we all cheered.      How loud must you scream   to save yourself   from the silent microphone,   from the encore that never comes?   How do you not fall into the pit   when you're the lightning rod   for everybody else's pain?      In the end, does it even matter,   if nobody was listening?      KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.      Luke Jongebloed,   cousin, kin --   little blond-haired boy   teasing your brother in family photos.   You loved Grandma's chocolate pie,   tearing open presents on Christmas Eve,   but at reunions,   you kept to the edges,   as if you'd already slipped away.      We hadn't spoken in some time,   you had your life, I had mine --   But when I heard the news   that you'd decided not to stay,   I realized how much our fates   may be written in our genes.       If you'd seen the half-written letters,   the roulette wheels I've spun,   how I've unraveled in midnight spirals,   would you have known   you weren't alone?   Would you have understood   maybe some of this was inherited?      I always thought it'd be me first.      But there's the noose,   swinging from our family tree --   and it's not my neck that's in it.      Death came so close this time   his breath heavy on my neck,   as he stalked my family.       And in the silence that followed   who you were and what you did,   as dirt falls on your casket,   I'm reminded: Our family   is such easy prey, picked off   one by one.      But maybe I don't want to die,   even if   the darkness wants our blood?      And so we count,   like children reciting fables --      one.   two.   three.      My final breath   is a wolf   pacing just outside the door.

Please Be Weird,wyndstorm77,"I like me a weirdo, someone who is a bit strange. It’s so fun to be yourself, even when others might think you’re deranged. We giggle and we laugh, always having a great time. While people on the outside wonder what is wrong with their minds.   I want to be free, free to scream and meow and soar. What’s the point of living if there’s nothing to live for? The truth is we’re all weird, whether we’ll admit it or not. We all have silly impulses and funny little thoughts.   If I were your doctor I’d say to you, “I prescribe to you some weird. Make sure to take it twice a day, or until your worries are cleared”. For in weirdness we are true, no more hiding or defeat. Weird is not an insult and to be yourself? Bro, that is such a sweet little treat.   So the next time you think “I can’t do that, it’d be super weird”.

What does it takes ?,Plenty_Mistake_9577,"What does it take to be a women? - I ask,   They said -   Spiritually - nothing  Biologically - a uterus   Societally -   .  When I was little with no sense in my thoughts,   Playing with my cars , eyeing my sister's dolls.  Wearing mom's lipstick making a crooked smile,  Too neat and I'll get beaten for crossing the line.  Rolling on the floor just to get one dress,   I couldn't understand the issue quite yet.  .  As I grew older my world split into two,   With a little beard it all came crashing through.  I ignored it, as if my soul didn't shatter,  Screamed 'I am a man' before my inner voice could rattle.   .  In a body that hung like some stranger's clothes,   I couldn't bear deafen the screams echoing at every shore.   They said my walk's a little girly, my voice is too low,  I felt ashamed, but should I be? I didn't know.   .  I just want to be girl and put ribbons in my hair,   wear a skirt and be gentle with myself.   I want my inner truth to be my outer shell,   breathe easy like I used to-  when pink and blue were just colors, not cells.  .  I am not a man, so don't call me a ""he"",  trapped in my body - struggling, unseen.   It's not a scar you can tend to,   or illness you can heal,  So I left my home when I was sixteen.    .  Stitched with courage, threaded by fear,  though shallow, i did make a tear.   for the first time, a weight was off my chest,   so I went to that party, knowing I shouldn't have.   And just like always they only saw a man,  This time wearing a pretty pink dress.   .  So I did it,   I shed the skin that never felt like mine,  And saw a reflection i could finally recognise.  With that I was given a new chance at life,   My place, my people and many reasons to smile.    .  'I am a women', is not just my truth,   It's my story.

Spent,ShootnSugar,This headache pounds in my skull.   Two coffees no water and no will to eat and its currently 938pm  I think I've been crying on and off since noon.

And I don't care if breath returns, If sun still rises, or the world still burns.  It’s pathetic, I know To live for someone who lets me go.

Lily ponds,ssoulis,"Lily Ponds  How wonderful —  A deep tint of green, with flowers that bloom in sync.   Sitting on waters so bright you must blink.   Like a white smile and two lips,  But not as beautiful as tulips. I won’t lisp for the truth —  I won’t let myself be seen like this, not for a minute.  Not in admiration or vulnerability,  But in a state where I only wish for content.  Let me look at lily ponds in peace.  Let me admire from a distance.  Let me love the unlovable, and fall for the unthinkable —  Because I am flawed and bothersome, like frogs on lily ponds.  Only there to bother or to comfort,  Never to show what it truly means.  What does it truly mean?  Nothing more than sounds, but far more than words.  How I wish there were words —  How I wish I could go on to explain.  But not now.  I can let them float in peace.  I should not fall to pieces,  Or make myself taste like blue cheeses.  I should sit with feelings, without always needing.  But I will always fall —  Maybe not shatter,  But always ignore the latter, because…  Boy, do I miss it.  Watching the lily ponds.

The silent storm,Top-Air461,"I wear a smile like borrowed skin, A mask to keep the demons in. They dance behind my weary eyes, And whisper truths disguised as lies.  The world moves on in golden light, While I dissolve in endless night. A shadow stretched across the floor, Too tired to fight, too broke to roar.  My heart, a house with shattered glass, Each breath a ghost that longs to pass. I scream, but sound won't ever form— It’s thunder trapped inside a storm.  They say, “You’re loved,” and maybe so, But love can’t reach where sorrows grow. It’s not your fault, it’s not neglect, It’s just a weight I can’t deflect.  I've built a smile, stitched every seam, But sink beneath this quiet stream. No one can see how deep it goes— The pain that hides in whispered throes.  So if I fade like autumn’s flame, Don't curse the wind or cast the blame. Just know I tried, with all my might, To hold the dark and chase the light.  If you're writing this for creative expression, I understand. But if you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed or struggling, please don’t carry it alone — talking to someone, even just one person, can change everything.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/JXstr5qieA   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/eVS2OHNeRk","i wear a smile like borrowed skin, a mask to keep the demons in. they dance behind my weary eyes, and whisper truths disguised as lies. the world moves on in golden light, while i dissolve in endless night. a shadow stretched across the floor, too tired to fight, too broke to roar. my heart, a house with shattered glass, each breath a ghost that longs to pass. i scream, but sound won't ever form it's thunder trapped inside a storm. they say, ""you're loved,"" and maybe so, but love can't reach where sorrows grow. it's not your fault, it's not neglect, it's just a weight i can't deflect. i've built a smile, stitched every seam, but sink beneath this quiet stream. no one can see how deep it goes the pain that hides in whispered throes. so if i fade like autumn's flame, don't curse the wind or cast the blame. just know i tried, with all my might, to hold the dark and chase the light. if you're writing this for creative expression, i understand. but if you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed or struggling, please don't carry it alone talking to someone, even just one person, can change everything."

Song of the wounded heart,Stalcko,"A flower blooms where sorrow sleeps, its color soft, yet brief,   Its petals kiss the soil below, where roots hold tight through grief. Though beauty fades, it blooms again, within the same old ground, The earth remembers every tear, and still, she makes no sound.  Above, the birds in silver arcs dare freedom with each wing, But winds can turn, and skies can dark, and storms begin to sing. To fly is more than joy alone; it's faith in staying high, When even light can lose its way across a trembling sky.  He holds the hours like brittle glass, afraid to let them fall, Each second shaped like something lost, or something not at all. He wants to cradle what he makes, yet breaks it in the end, A fear that even love, when born, is something to defend.  But gentle hands can gather light where others see just ash, And stitch the silence back to song with every softened flash. She doesn’t rush the broken stem, nor curse the evening rain, She only waits, and in her calm, the world can bloom again.  Now sky, soil, time and care, move easy side by side, Their burdens softened into song, no longer need to hide. They share the quiet, share the light, with laughter like the breeze, Even the old and wounded hearts can find a kind of peace.

THE PROMISE-WEIGHT,nagamidge,"Beneath the tent-ribs, Yamma’s breath a thread,   Ukhti’s small hand clutched cold in Amir’s own.   Thirteen hard years scourged his frame, a hunger-fed,   Gaunt architecture built of skin and bone.   He kissed her brow, “Ukhti, be strong for Yamma.”   The promise hung: Bread by the evening’s fall.   Twelve kilometres etched in Gaza’s drama,   A pilgrim tracing hope’s mirage-lined wall.    West Rafah called. His feet, bare maps of stone   Knew every shard, each rutted track and dune.   They say that place gives bread and death as one;   That bullets greet the starving every noon.   But Amir knew no other path to try-   He walked the razor edge where hopes undo.   The sun, a molten coin, beat flesh to bone,   A kiln where will alone held hunger true.    A river rose- gaunt bodies moving slow   Toward rumoured gates, where white men gave reprieve.   He joined the flow, let grief and worry go,   Fixed on one thought: What Yamma must receive.   The fence loomed stark. A crush of bone and sigh,   Sweat’s sting, the sand’s relentless burn and glare.   Hope choked the air, thick as the desert sky,   As hidden watchers tracked the tide of prayer.    Then came a groan- a surge, a sudden shout.   Amir slipped eel-like through the human stream,   Threaded the gaps where stronger men gave out,   And reached the front- a sliver of a dream.   A canvas chair. A man with hair like flax,   Hands giving parcels, sealed and clean and square.   Amir stepped up, received the precious stacks:   Flour’s pale promise, lentils’ sober care.   Joy, sharp and sudden, pierced the hollow ache.   He placed the burdens down upon the ground,   Then cupped the startled stranger’s face, to make   Thanks flesh: dry palms on cheeks, a silent sound.   He raised the weathered hand, pressed lips, devout,   To knuckles pale. A benediction brief.   “Thank you.” The English words, a fragile shout   Against the vast indifference of grief.   He gathered up the promise-weights anew,   Turned homeward, heart a bird despite the load.    A thump. A sting. A hiss. The grey plume grew,   Thick serpent coiling on the aid-strewn road.   Confusion’s fist clenched tight. A gasp, a cry.   He ran. Pure instinct, legs like splintered reeds   Propelled by terror’s lash beneath the sky.   Then came the sound- the harvest of grim seeds-   Sharp cracks that split the air, that hunted men.   Don’t look. Just run. Just run. His mantra beat.   But sudden force, a searing then,   Drove breath and balance from his stumbling feet.    He fell. The parcels flew. A crate-edge tore   The lentil sack. Small stones of hope burst free,   A scatter-pattern on the dusty floor.   The flour sack landed, spilling partially.   He clawed the grit. Get up! Retrieve! Command   Issued, ignored. His limbs were foreign clay.   He dragged an arm, a wounded crab on land,   Toward the lentils lost beside the way.    That’s when he saw the river, swift and bright,   Crimson and urgent, flowing from his core.   His own life’s tide, relentless in its flight,   Overtook lentils spilled upon the floor.   It swirled around them, stained them, deep and rich,   A grotesque irrigation, warm and fast.   Pain bloomed, immense. The world began to pitch,   A warmth that promised it would be the last.    Tears blurred. He blinked, one monumental strain.   Saw clearly: lentils drowned in vibrant red.   The sun beat down. He whispered through the pain,   ""Sorry, Yamma… Ukhti… I found… the bread.   I rest… but... just for… a little while…"" The light   Flickered. The promise-weight dissolved in red   The flour ghosted pale in fading sight.   The river carried all the words unsaid.    @@@@@@############@@@@@    For those of you who have reached this far, thank you for not turning away or stopping half way.

To the Girl Behind the Pharmacy Counter,CulturingPoems,"# [To the Girl Behind the Pharmacy Counter](https://poems.culturing.net/2023/12/to-the-girl-behind-the-pharmacy-counter/)  *18 December 2023*  You with the smile, asking favors with eyes only,   yes, I remember you too. But this is not the time   for a dance or the courting of pairs. You have asked me   to take my time, and I shall, as I linger over   what time has brought me. Not the east, or the sun,   but just you, with all faults still at this moment concealed.   Shall we remember fondly this meeting when hours of argument   wrangle our spirits, or when we find habits distasteful   which each of us cannot change? Yes, we shall, with disdain,   for it's always the same, as the first blush transforms   to the flush of rage, for we puppets on Nature's marionette.   You can bet it will happen again, as it's happened before,   even here, and to us, as we each go our ways   through the spasms of time.

i only miss you when i'm high,ghostpoett,"**TW: Emotional manipulation / substance use**    when I get high,   I start mourning people who aren’t even dead.   start wondering if I was too quick to leave,   like the pain they gave me   was just my fault for bruising too easily—   like I imagined the whole thing   and bled from a wound that wasn’t real.  when I get high,   I start rehearsing apologies   for things I didn’t do,   convincing myself I was the problem   just so someone else doesn’t have to be—   like if I rewrite the story gentle enough,   maybe the ache will start to disappear.  when I get high,   I forget why I walked away.

“I Didn’t Say Goodbye Right”,Poetic_wanderer,"I left like a whisper, not a storm, No slamming doors, no final form. I just faded slow, unseen, A ghost between the might-have-beens.  You didn’t ask, and I didn’t explain, Just nodded through the growing pain. I laughed at jokes I didn’t feel, And smiled like silence was a deal.  We talked, but only on the skin You didn’t know the war within. And maybe that’s the cruelest part You never saw me fall apart.  I won’t write a bitter verse, I won’t wish you pain or curse. But late at night, when truths replay, I ache for things I didn’t say.  Not that I loved you though I did. Not that I tried though that’s well hid. Just this: I left with quiet eyes, Because loud goodbyes feel too much like lies.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/r9iIKsoFuU https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/F33MwQ5S5l","i left like a whisper, not a storm, no slamming doors, no final form. i just faded slow, unseen, a ghost between the might-have-beens. you didn't ask, and i didn't explain, just nodded through the growing pain. i laughed at jokes i didn't feel, and smiled like silence was a deal. we talked, but only on the skin you didn't know the war within. and maybe that's the cruelest part you never saw me fall apart. i won't write a bitter verse, i won't wish you pain or curse. but late at night, when truths replay, i ache for things i didn't say. not that i loved you though i did. not that i tried though that's well hid. just this i left with quiet eyes, because loud goodbyes feel too much like lies."
Why to Love?,Rhaegal6,"Why to love:  Why shall our paths get entwined? when not our hands do?  Why am I to endure the burden of love that I not can have?  Why to love; O to be buried?        Why shall you possess the virtuous love; when it shall not be given;  To the other virtuous soul of mine; but to the soul of him framed of vigour shell.  Why do I stand beside the tree: Framed of vigour shell;  Whist you the sunshine shall glow on I and my children that shall resemble your eyes.        Are you the passing cloud; thus I shall be to blame;  To Exist, to be still beside you, to admire you.  Why are you not Moon; Shining on I for ever;  Thus let me gleam, let me live with your love.

But you made it clear When you walked out the door That you no longer felt the same.   You said feelings change; Things change It’s time we moved on. These words,   they cut like a knife.    I wrap my arms around me, To shield me from the cold. As I sit here and watch, The smoke burns out of yet another cigarette in the ashtray.    Wish I could forget you.  I want to forget you.

Softness Without Disappearing,theliminalfox,"*(Her POV)*  The air was heavy that morning.   The sun shined too bright.   Birds too loud   for the storm cloud   I was carrying.  You poured the tea.   I didn’t say thank you    not because I forgot,   but because you already knew.  The house wasn’t quiet.   It was held.   Softly padded with intention.   Mug to coaster.   Light left dim.   Curtains drawn, but not closed.  My socks didn’t match.   I hadn’t eaten.   I was all edges    skin too loud,   bones too tired to arrange.  You brought me fruit.   Cut small. No skin.   The kind I didn’t have to chew with guilt.  You didn’t ask what was wrong.   You didn’t have to.  We folded laundry   without speaking.   You gave my favourite plush his seat back   after I’d dropped him   on a bad day   and walked away    oblivious, numb.  And when I cried    not loudly,   not beautifully    but the kind of crying   that tucks itself in a corner   and doesn’t dare ask to be seen   You didn’t flinch.   You just sorted socks.   You wiped the bench again.   You stayed in the room   and made it bigger.  You stayed.   So I did too.  And in that silence,   I remembered softness   doesn’t have to vanish   to be safe.  ---  **The Way She Stayed**   *(His POV)*  I didn’t ask what was wrong.   It’s not because I didn’t care.  I knew.   I saw it.  The mug wasn’t where she usually left it.   Her favourite plush was missing from the couch.   She didn’t hum when the kettle boiled.  Something had left the air.  So I made the tea.   The good one.   The one she saved for “after.”  I sliced the apple   the way she liked   but never asked for    wedged, peeled, soft.  I didn’t ask, “Are you okay?”   Because she wasn’t.   And that wasn’t the point.  I just moved gently.   Sat nearby.   Sorted socks into familiar pairs.   Cleared the crumbs from the bench.   Touched nothing that asked to be left alone.  I let her silence bloom.   I didn’t pluck it.   I didn’t fill it with kindness meant for me.  And when she cried    not the kind that begs for arms,   but the kind that hopes not to be seen   I stayed.  I didn’t rescue.   I didn’t vanish.   I didn’t explain the quiet away.  And maybe   she didn’t say thank you.  But she didn’t leave either.  And that’s when I knew:   she still trusted the room   we made together.   Still let it hold her,   without asking it to heal her.

Pressure,DaveJDash,"Hey, how's it going?   Looks like you've been doing well.   Thought I'd check in.   Did you forget what you promised?   Those things you said you'd do?   I know you're having a good time,   Making progress,   Growing, making strides, all that.   Just thought I'd remind you.      It's time to put your head down and work.   The others are waiting for you.   Sure, take care of yourself.   Just — just don't forget about your obligations.   You're important.   They're counting on you.      I know, I know,   It's been so long since you've relaxed,   Since you've stopped working,   Taken a break,   Had some leisure,   You know what I mean.   There's not that much left to do.      At least, not before you need to get back to work.   Or make more money.   Or help somebody else.   But what's all that,   When you're doing it for those you love?   The sacrifice is worth it.   It's not that much, really.      Good, good,   You've got some time to recharge.   Take that time.   Just not too much time.   Don't get me wrong,   It's good for you to have it.   But they need you more.   Get back out there as soon as you can.      What?   You don't have the energy?   Well, that's disappointing.   You really can't muster it?   You probably can,   If you try.   Try harder.   Just a matter of effort and availability.      Don't worry about the toll.   The time will come for you.   When?   That's asking the wrong question.   That's not what this is about.   Anyway, you might feel a bit zapped.   That's not important.   You can still be present,   Do it all,   Get the job done,   All things to all people.      What you perceive,   The others noticing your fatigue,   Your dejection,   Your irritability,   Your turmoil,   I see it.   It's no small thing.   But it's not time for that.   Push through, respond,   Be there for them.   That's all.      Trust me,   You're good enough now,   With the desires left hanging,   The body left unfed,   The mind stretched,   The transcendent impulses quieted.   That's all they need.   Just you.

Ode to the Left Guard,RobertaELee,"  Ode to the Left Guard  In a line filled with ogres, He is still the smallest. Six-three, two-ninety-five, But not close to the tallest.  No outside-the-pocket glory; No audibles to call. Just relentless double-teams, Pulling ahead of the ball.  The stats for him are vague, but Without him: all punts. And when comes fourth and inches, His battered body, it hunts!  Whether trap, sweep, or pass protect, His quick feet always there. His massive paws and forearms— To the backer-brutes, he dares.  Another three or six through drives Again goes on the board. The wide-out spikes in triumph;  And dances once it’s scored.  But where is he?  In trenches deep and dire, Caked in filth and caustic mud. From cheek, arm, and busted limb Drip rivers of crimson blood.  He is tradesman, soldier, all at once; But what beneath each layer? A Brobdingnagian presence, yes— But fierce heart and soul. True player.  Line life is never easy; ‘tis Violent, fast, and hard. And so it goes for anyone Who suits up at left guard.  And years later, knees shattered And brain much worse for wear. Movement itself? Hard labor; A wrenching cross to bear.  But any life worth living Measures in inches, downs, and yards.

I’m unsure about my poetry need feedback also recommend titles.,TechnicianIcy8163," I love smiles. I love synchronicity. I love my bunny teeth, and I love being a child with children. I love ocean waves and purple hues on my hands. I love ghosts on bridges and rivers that run on and on. But I also love rivers when they stop and condense into stillness. I love hide and seek, but I hate seeking and being found. I love excitement— but also, numb tranquility.  I love hedonism, but they tell me to love rationality. Rationality is peace, and I love that— but peace prevents dreams, and I hate that. Well… isn’t it like poetry? Some say it should be complex. Some prefer simplicity. Cant it just be poetry? When love loves to love love, the vertigo is insanity? And if falling is freedom— then I would.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/8yWW69g7Nq  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/KyEffABXrn","i love smiles. i love synchronicity. i love my bunny teeth, and i love being a child with children. i love ocean waves and purple hues on my hands. i love ghosts on bridges and rivers that run on and on. but i also love rivers when they stop and condense into stillness. i love hide and seek, but i hate seeking and being found. i love excitement but also, numb tranquility. i love hedonism, but they tell me to love rationality. rationality is peace, and i love that but peace prevents dreams, and i hate that. well... isn't it like poetry? some say it should be complex. some prefer simplicity. cant it just be poetry? when love loves to love love, the vertigo is insanity? and if falling is freedom then i would."

Some Loves don't make a sound!,Poetic_wanderer,"We didn’t meet like movies show, No sparks flew high, no skies aglow. It started slow just eyes that stayed, A quiet smile that never swayed.  No perfect lines, no scripted part, Just late-night talks and open heart. You learned my silence, I your fears, We stitched our past with patient years.  You saw the mess behind my charm, Still held my shaking hand with calm. No pedestal, no worship throne Just two cracked souls who made a home.  We fought like hell, we laughed like fire, We lost the script, we climbed up higher. Through storm and still, through wrong and right, You were the war and still the light.  You weren’t the dream I used to chase, But real as rain upon my face. Not perfect, no, but damn sincere You stayed when love meant facing fear.  So no, this isn’t fairy-tale bound, Some loves don’t fly, they root the ground. And if they ask what love looks like  I'll point to us, through dark and bright.   ""Not every love story is loud.

Before I Knew Not to Hope,Vibes-And-Vinegar,"You were twelve.   I was nine.   Too small to matter,   too close not to.    We wrestled on the living room carpet    like kids who hadn’t learned    what not to touch.   You let me win,   sometimes.   Or maybe I was stronger than you thought.    Your laugh:   always louder than mine,   always unafraid.     In your room with schoolwork spread between us,   you’d scribble answers,   tap your pen against your lip,   then draw stars on my wrist    without thinking.   Over fractions, then physics, then years    that didn’t feel like years.     Little constellations    between bone and skin.   Like celestial maps I never read right.    No asking.   No reason.   Like it meant nothing.    Which, I guess, it did.      But I kept still.   Like maybe if I didn’t move,   you’d keep drawing.    You kissed me once.   A joke we both pretended was funny.   Truth or dare.    Your breath smelled like root beer    and I pretended    my heart didn’t do anything strange.    You were always going to outgrow me.   I knew.   Even then.    The girls your age wore mascara    and laughed     quieter.   I had skinned knees    and pencil smudges on my hands.    And five years later,   you said my name like it didn’t mean anything.

Love Me- A chronic illness poem,Marforstars,"  One day I’ll be trapped in this body. My hands will be curled in, my spine unbreakable bent into unnatural curls that matches the curl of my ebony hair with only the slightest sliver of gray. Feet bowed and tight bound to the silver throne wheeled by bed maids. Tortured day in and out, a morphine drip drip dripping into my chest soothing a body that once dreamt of more.  Of more. Of more.   A body once swept away with the count of 8, now follows the pallid drip of morphine slowly dripping away the mind that dreamt of more.   I hope, when I reach this point someone will kill me. Give me grace and mercy. Let my tense muscles relax for the first time in decades. Let my spine unfurl like a butterflies cocoon. Release me into the light and the rainbows and the people who love me. Love me. Love me. Kill me. Please.    When my brain drifts away into a silver dream, where roses are sunflowers, do not let me be.  Love me.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NJ4Pk3Oz41  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/86zp7WTts6","one day i'll be trapped in this body. my hands will be curled in, my spine unbreakable bent into unnatural curls that matches the curl of my ebony hair with only the slightest sliver of gray. feet bowed and tight bound to the silver throne wheeled by bed maids. tortured day in and out, a morphine drip drip dripping into my chest soothing a body that once dreamt of more. of more. of more. a body once swept away with the count of 8, now follows the pallid drip of morphine slowly dripping away the mind that dreamt of more. i hope, when i reach this point someone will kill me. give me grace and mercy. let my tense muscles relax for the first time in decades. let my spine unfurl like a butterflies cocoon. release me into the light and the rainbows and the people who love me. love me. love me. kill me. please. when my brain drifts away into a silver dream, where roses are sunflowers, do not let me be. love me."

Repeatedly…..  Why does your searing pain clear my mind so,  And show me who is friend and who is foe  Oh, what a fool I am  To converse with you once again    Behold! Passion the great beast of Rome,  With Mane Of fire and tusk of the puriest stone  May you guide my spirit through life's great poem  Oh what a fool I am  To matador with you once again    Kings and Queens gather round,  And listen to the fool who bears the false crown  For I shall tell it to your face  The path you walk ends in last place    Be damned upon the cross of your golden intentions  Or speak to your gods of true actions,  For the time of madness is upon us  And all of you are weak and utterly groundless      **The Duty to the Forest!**  THE FOREST ARE EMPTY!  THE FOREST ARE EMPTY!  The satyrs, spirits and nymphs that once roamed free.  Have abandoned even the mighty apple tree  Replaced by men who beget their duty three!  So those who forget listen to me!    Your first duty is to the divine whatever that might be,  Know, while you may be a question, never the answer key,  And no matter how fast you run, one day you too shall leave    Your second duty is to the wisdom to set your brother free,  For knowledge is how we become the oak tree,  To shelter those who find themselves weak!    Your third duty is to the earth, wind, and sea,  For the world is on fire and the soil can no longer cultivate seed  For we must war against the demon we know as greed,  Men who are blinded by the lure of freedom,  Do not forget your duty three-     **The lie**  LIES IN THE COURTROOM  LIES IN THE HALL  LIES IN THE CHURCH, CASTLE AND BALL.  They have stolen from our mother and given to your lord,  The title of creator is not his to horde!   Tell me of a man who has birthed another,  A job only a goddess can ever endeavor!  So I ask you of Abrahamic faith,  Why your father acts in such distaste-  To discredit his partner and claim all the glory  While rewriting the script while rewriting the story.

IS IT FAIR ?,Turtle_0D,"For the world, he may be just one person. But for her, he was the whole world.  It’s easy to judge, to laugh, to question her, but hard to stand where she stands.

I met him again today,Agreeable-Cow7265,"I did it again!  I talked with him again,  Even when I said to myself Not to,   Just go do what you need to do and come back, I thought,  But when I saw him, it was different.  My mind changed.

We are not friends anymore.  Why do I feel so sad even after me being the one who ended things..  Well, I ended cause I knew we couldn't end up together, not because I didn't like him.  And I know.  I know he loves me. I can see it.   But I can't let him see through me.  Cause if I tell him I know he wouldn't leave me alone.   He would stay by me.   Wants to fight for me.

But my voice couldn't come out.  I wanted to tell him , I love you!  But I didn't wanna hurt him any longer.   I know that I hurt the man who loved me.

The Cliff,ShootnSugar," As I stand upon the ever-shifting precipice of self  And wonder in my turmoil if I’m truly someone else  If I uphold the values that I claim to emulate  And how my contribution to the world will change its shape   I begin to paint two pictures: one of guilt and seeking blame  But the other is of hope for something greater to my name  One might argue that is prideful and defeative of the purpose  But I see, that pride when humble, might be deemed as righteous   Society is shifting but mentality stays true  And with it comes a contradiction battling the new  We have tried to put a focus on the unity we crave  And yet it’s been opposed in the most trivial of ways   We look to passion for ambition and new ways to educate  We’re moving towards a new definition “healthy state”  Yet denial can be powerful and indeed so can be fear  So its true sometimes the negative is easier to hear   I see the change that could be looming to some, who still don’t understand  I see the hate from those who were raised before the tides had shifted sands  Though I can’t see the bottom now and how exactly we got down  I argue I can teach someone to climb up again, somehow   To be the kind of person who will dive down from the edge  Through the murkiest of waters, to begin the dreaded dredge  To wade with open ears and an empathetic heart  But also to take stands against the wrong and do my part   Helping all of us move forward, no matter time or effort for this world  But then dawns upon me, I am small and still and girl  The task, it seems so daunting it overwhelms me as I ponder  And, yet I still persist as my thoughts still seem to wonder   Can I make a difference in a way that is impactful?  Do I have the strength to carry on and still be grateful?  How do I contain myself when I am growing weary?  And will I just continue in pursuit of some found glory?   Does it start to taint my actions; cause though I’m focused on the better  It’s, so I can live there too in a place that suits my pleasure?

"Live By The Sword, Die By Words",ExaminationOwn3456,"Live by the sword, die by words.  It’s a pain that transcends the feeling of being stabbed. It’s a fear created by a distant dad. It’s a pain that hurts worse than death— a death that comes only when you seek rest.  You feel the metal beneath your skin, but it’s the kind of battle only one person can win.  I live by the sword, fighting battles in my head every day just to feel a little bit more okay.  I feel the cuts, the stabs, the gashes— but still, it’s me that my mind lashes.  I lived by the sword, and now I die by words-  the ones that tear open my soul, taking out the parts of me I used to know.  Empty promises, meant to make you think more positive. Empty words that seal your view, that refuse to acknowledge what I’ve been through.  “You’re doing well.” I don’t hear that a lot. But even when I do, it still feels like hell.  It’s like a messed-up crossword puzzle where every clue is a question about my own self-worth.  I wish it was fire. I could walk through it and just be burned.  Maybe then they’d notice. Maybe then it wouldn’t just be the rocks of my mind left unturned.

The Math Of My Self Hate,ExaminationOwn3456," I hope that one day I’ll be able to count my reasons to live as well as I count my calories.  That one day I won’t be afraid of seeing numbers on a scale. For when I see them rise, My face goes pale, And I feel like I fail.  When my weight goes up, My worth goes down, And I feel like a clown Trapped in a house of mirrors.  But I hope this one is faulty, For I can’t see what there is to like. My proportions far off, I wished this one would shatter— That the number on a scale and in my head wouldn’t matter.  I want to eat a meal without guilt, To live in a world without the numbers. For when I see them, I wilt.  I’m a flower bending under its own weight, The stem—its body— That it’s come to hate.  It knows it’s still growing, But its weight is showing. So off comes a leaf, Off goes my belief.  There is not much room left in this mind of mine. I’m tired of pretending like I think my body’s fine. I think it’s crossed a line.  As my numbers rise higher, It’s more and more self-hate I learn to acquire.

None of my poems are worthy of a title,Green_Event5141,"Between the scarlett skies and shadowed earth, I stand, fractured — a man caught in the seam.  Love and despair are twin serpents, coiled deep in my ribcage, whispering promises and curses alike.  I reached for grace — in her, I thought I found it, that fragile flame that could warm the frozen parts, the shattered parts, the parts no one ever asked to see.  She was the siren — the voice both angelic and cruel, singing songs I longed to believe, only to leave me shipwrecked on jagged rocks.  I wore a mask — hand-carved and heavy, built from twisted faith, a mosaic of prayers and hardened vows. It was my fortress, my tomb, the shape of survival.  But beneath that mask, my heart bled starry red — hooked on false hopes, betrayed again by the very thing that sought love.  I tried to fold into her world, play the fool, the jester, lay down arms I never truly held.  And when she left, I carved a wall of fire, swore never again to bleed for anyone but God, whose eyes never faltered, whose hands never crushed.  Yet, in the dark, the shadows creep — fingers of doubt, rage, and twisted faith, whispering the truth I don’t want to hear: I am alone here, walking cursed earth beneath a sky heavy with blood and promise.  No evangelist, no preacher — only a man with prayers woven tight, holding fast to a faith that bends but does not break.  I walk through this masquerade, an actor in a never-ending play, changing faces, mask hardening like stone.  But beneath it all, there is a quiet tenacity — a drug, a numbness, a hope that maybe, just maybe, there is a chance —  A chance with condition, a chance with betrayal, a chance with death — but a chance nonetheless.  Between the scarlett and the shadows, I find my truth:  Not perfect, not whole, but enough. A fractured soul, wearing my mask, bearing my wounds, walking forward into a world that never promised mercy —  But where I still hold God’s light, scarlett as dawn, sharp as blood, steadfast as the stars.

Drunkard’s Progress,pucktherat,"For a while you sat at step #2 -  A glass to keep the cold out. Now you’re leaning against the wall, falling off the eighth step unconscious and dropping drool into my eyes  and the beer is always flat. After you staggered down the avenue all night I ate the candy bar stashed below the stoop for breakfast And let it crawl into the space in my stomach.  The sixteen maggots burrowing inside me Enjoy squirming here better than staying in the chocolate. They fester in the lining and our friends keep sticking matches Down my throat to try to smoke them out. “All I want is some sort of grace” with my hands up to god But I don’t remember what I’m talking about So you break your bottle over my skull to get me thinking straight  Before you slip your tongue through the new gaps in our teeth To kiss me rotten while I wrap you in newspapers.  They smell foul and they say that we’re dying but I do it To protect you from the weather so I can tell you that I hope you don’t survive the sunrise. You plug up my nosebleed and I butt  my head into your face to settle the score.  You wrap the 40 around our hands with gauze  and you tell me you host the maggots, too.  The stomach squirms for a reason  And the infested organs pull us down towards the foot of the stairs  where everything is still and everything is hell. You dust the bits of broken glass out of my hair  And stick them under my fingernails so I can dig six feet down. There’s a dark brown shard lodged at the nape of my neck  so I pull it out and hold it up to the light And it looks golden when the sun streams through it Like cathedral glass or a beer bottle or cathedral glass. I slide it into the slit of your belly button and ask you if you feel it.

Borderline,MKthereal,"Here it comes again.   just gotta keep it in.   Hold it one more time don't let it win.   Stay strong and hold that grin.   Don't let em know what's goin on within.    Been down this road before.   Spiraling through memory lane.   Down it so many times my mind's getting sore.   From all the memories I recall.   Everytime like I've never been here before.   Scramblin' every hall.   lookin' for a door.   To hide behind in case I cant hold anymore.   Mind's running out of breath, vision's blurry.   Walls are getting closer.   Heartbeat's growing louder.   Voices going quieter.   Colors drained all's going ivory.   Tongue’s frozen, soul's yellin' help me.   Thought this was over, all behind me.   Born for flight with broken wings forced to fight.    know its a long shot and I'm no lancer.   But I've lost myself and need an answer.   The pit in my chest's getting deeper.   Therapy's not working and I'm even weaker.   Oscillating between mania 'n crippling hysteria.   Oﬃcially living on the edge, borderline.   Not in denial, know things won't be fine.

"“Because It Was Itchy, I Stopped.“",loceapeace,"  The milk I sipped that morning still clung to the roof of my mouth. The bus never came. At the fold of the afternoon, a cloth that failed to speak sneered. A death with no reply. Who first mouthed its rhyme? A bent sound remained unpasted. The emptied shelf repeated voices from long ago.  　  A face tagged with sweetness traced the air with fingers that hadn’t fully cooled, as if reusing yesterday’s heat. The face that refused its turn preserved its silence inside the screen. Tongueless customers stood in line, pretending to know they were standing in for someone else.  　  What had been seared into the skin was the correctness called “It couldn’t be helped.” Beneath the mumbling, a shadow that kept refusing proof was rotting. Breaths were left in the aisles, and a joke that hadn’t yet been thrown away was quietly swelling. A voice, half-stitched, was scraping.  　  “I knew it was lying there. My shoe only made a sound when I stepped on it.”  I turned back, just a little. But when I reached to pick it up, my finger itched—so I stopped. I never wondered whose sound it had been.  “The moment we pointed and laughed, he collapsed. But no one had actually looked at the pointing finger.”  　  Because no one had killed, it was arranged. There were enough chairs, but no one sat. The shoes that were scheduled to die before noon were still walking. What sank there was a weight untouched by any hand.  　  The one who was waiting—was me. Before it could reach anyone’s mouth, the sound had already dried up. “This is unrelated,” said a scraped voice, and then I fell silent. I had really just been asleep. And the moment I thought that excuse would do, what remained wasn’t a name— but a weight.    ---    “Because It Was Itchy, I Stopped.“｜Interpretive Poem   　  What went unpicked wasn’t guilt— but the blur in the urge to touch it. “It was itchy” is not forgiveness. It’s merely the one refusal the speaker was allowed to make.  　  This poem is a caricature of inaction, where systems and ethics settle into the backs of those who “did nothing.”  　  The joke was never discarded. Laughter only swelled atop someone’s corpse. The true culprit wasn’t malice but indifference. And no one tried to prove it. (That, too, was the system’s job.)  　  The shoes kept walking. Only the time scheduled for death survived. No one took responsibility, yet the weight was undeniably there.  　  So perhaps, the true subject of this poem is not “I” but “the silence of someone who didn’t laugh.”  　  The tsuchinoko is long gone. But a society that never stumbles over its absence— can it really claim to be unrelated?  　  To ask that, a finger that merely itched might not have been enough.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 ","the milk i sipped that morning still clung to the roof of my mouth. the bus never came. at the fold of the afternoon, a cloth that failed to speak sneered. a death with no reply. who first mouthed its rhyme? a bent sound remained unpasted. the emptied shelf repeated voices from long ago. a face tagged with sweetness traced the air with fingers that hadn't fully cooled, as if reusing yesterday's heat. the face that refused its turn preserved its silence inside the screen. tongueless customers stood in line, pretending to know they were standing in for someone else. what had been seared into the skin was the correctness called ""it couldn't be helped."" beneath the mumbling, a shadow that kept refusing proof was rotting. breaths were left in the aisles, and a joke that hadn't yet been thrown away was quietly swelling. a voice, half-stitched, was scraping.

The Pixie and the DO,laricifus,"It waits alone in a cage built for two,   It sunders and wonders what pain means to you.   She waits in slumber, knowing pain is her truth,   And the darkness comes knocking   Knock knocking a tooth.    It keeps going to find what it can,   And finds its own sadness is only what’s left.   It leans down to give the pixie a kiss   And with darkness she grows until the knight is unblessed.   The thing goes knocking, knock knocking— with haste   And the pain the knight once knew becomes haunting again.   He knows not what to do, but let the knocking begin.    I once knew a song to chivalry be true,   But now everything is wrong, and daunting in truth   I try so hard, but the hate runs deep,   And nothing, nothing can save them from me.   I knows how to knock   Knock knocking a tooth,   And the anger I harbor is known to but one.   So how can my forgiveness ever be won.    I imagine again and see the pixie’s fine hair,   Her wings and her eyes, bring me out of despair.   My armor returns and the thing dissipates,   It comes back for a taste and I swing with great haste.   It lunges forward with a lumbering slash,   Shattering my shield with a thunderous clash.   The Darkness is winning and armor is peeled   So I reach up In anger as love spreads its mouth   And I bite that darkness right on the tooth.    The knight is overcome with feelings of surrender,   But a calm light radiates from within the darkness's place   and all becomes clear to the knight what's in front of his face.   It is neither here nor there, not he nor I,   But something cold that remains mingled in all our souls.   Something old that we must all learn to hold.   The darkness tries to take him in suit,   But he does not buckle for he know his truth.   Nothing, oh nothing, will come knock knocking his tooth.    The darkness is banished and   The two embrace in their cage.   But they both will remember,   That the darkness has a place   Outside of their page.   With locks of feather and   Skin of oil, the Old One   Will send her willingness again.   It knows but one truth   And that is it's name.   The Dark One comes knocking,   Knock knocking again.   You’ll let it keep knocking   If you let it in,   But eat it you must   To let love in again.    The knight and pixie together at last,   Go knocking, knock knocking on the pearly   Black gates.    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This is the first part in a series of poems I'm working on, would be great to get some feedback and see if there is any interest in seeing the rest.

The Ritual In-Between,zyerhod1,"**The Ritual In-Between**   *by Bryon Slack*  They came in hush.   Shifting beings   whose forms blurred   at the edges,   lingering between   shadow and mist   until Her gaze   called them still.  They carried silence   in open hands,   tongues wound   in ribbons of perhaps,   eyes reflecting ache   they would not name.  Their offerings   spilled like memory—   uncontained,   but never   quite enough   to stain the stone.  Their verses curled   like smoke,   and vanished   as courage often does   when met with flame   before the words   can name the author.  But She does not eat mist.      Truth stands bare—   unhooded, unblinking,   Her silence louder   than any empty   word shaped like flowers   with no teeth.  She does not reach   for the presented mirrors,   their edges beveled and   faces smoked to make   Her words cut less deeply.  Songs that wrapped Her   harshness in velvet softness   came discordant from   quivering, timid throats   causing dark clouds   to pass over Her   countenance.  Each failed supplicant   of shadow and dream fell away   from Her like morning   mist before the dawn   as I stepped forward.  My head bowed in shame,   I admitted my failings   in low, sure tones.   I spoke of allowing   the sight She had given   me to be colored   by Desire and Truth's   own despised sister,   Hypocrisy.  My raiments dropped around   me and I stood ready   to accept Her Judgement,   bare and unmasked.   Her hand reached out beneath   my chin until my gaze locked   with Hers.

The postman time forgot,Due-Presentation3959,"The Postman Time Forgot  Narrator: The Postman (a cursed figure who reads undelivered love letters) Observing figures: Time (silent), the Poet (absent), the Muse (never replied)    They never told me letters could bleed, That envelopes weep what the mouths don't plead. They handed me grief in ribbon and lace, Stamped with hope, and sealed in disgrace.  I was the keeper of truths unsent, Of sighs wrapped in sweet intent. But now I open them, one by one, And read what’s left when love is done.  The ink is cracked, the lines decay, But I feel each word like a knife in clay. Not paper no this is skin once kissed, And every letter is a pulse I missed.  He wrote of stars she’d never see, Of nights that begged her memory. He loved her in ways no god could bless, With hands that shook beneath his chest.  But she was silence, clothed in form, A name that danced but kept no warm. The letters pile like autumn’s regret, Unread, unclaimed, unanswer’d yet.  They say I’m just a courier ghost, But I carry what you fear the most Not death, not fire, but love misplaced, A prayer to a god who erased her face.  I read his lines through tears he drank, “I’d trade the sun just to feel you thank Me for a love that asked for none, Only a glance before I’m gone.”  But gone he is the poet’s dust, Drowned in ink, betrayed by trust. No farewell kiss, no final sign, Just pages torn by phantom time.  Some poems rot before they’re read, Some lovers die before they’re dead. And I the bearer of breathless pleas Am cursed to kneel with trembling knees.  For every letter speaks to me, Not to the one they wished would see. And still I walk, through rain and ruin, Through towns where dreams forget their tune.  I knock on doors no hands unlatch, I slip through cracks, no hearts attach. They burned the writer, lost the song, Yet left me with the notes so wrong.  I carry verses no one keeps, Of poets drowned in unsent weeps. She never knew what she inspired And now his bones are cold, retired.  She wasn’t the reason I was the ruin, She didn't love me; she left a lesson I cannot learn. He wrote those words before he broke, Before his candle died in smoke.  And Time just watched, like stars from shore, Too old to grieve, too tired to mourn. It whispered once, as winds will do, “Even I cannot undo what’s true.”  I folded back the final page, As dusk crept through the iron cage. And wept for him for every line, A funeral held in postal time.

Chess,Static_User_88,"  They call it a game of battle and tactics, but I think there's more to it. Perhaps rival kingdoms with two kings who were once best friends.

The Guilt of Never Being Enough,vazelineee,"What’s the biggest regret of your life?   Mine?    Never being enough.  It’s like...    I have the firewood,    But no spark to light it.

"I, who will be forever. Again.",star_child13,"# I, who will be forever. Again.  By Sumo. (Dylan NoLastName)  Why do you live such a finite existence?  The most widely accepted theory for the end of the universe is the heat death theory. Life is but a burning flame only so much kindling to go around.  But it will eventually burn out no matter what we do. After such a long time– honestly you wouldn’t get it even if I tried to explain– the darkness will snuff out the final spark of life. And entropy will take everything you love and then you. Everything is dust, meaningless to the sands of time.  But why?  Something doesn’t make sense… if everything is destined to return to nothing, consumed by the end… then why am I here writing this. Why are you there reading it?  If it is to be ripped apart then how is it possible for it to begin?  Atoms flinging across the vacuum of space, millions of years with not a single sign of another… thing. Just darkness.  But over infinity. It will exist in every possible part of the universe. Even if the universe expands forever it’s nothing to the power of time. It will forever exist in every possible place in the universe.  But if that’s so then how can it be possible that it doesn’t collide with a single other atom and jump start the universe?  Given time, an endless… basically unfathomable amount of time it will one day eventually collide with another and thus the darkness has failed once again. To its own machinations it can not stop the universe.  Unless everything is pulled apart perfectly and held there perfectly forever then it’s not possible for the universe to end. Because in infinity there is an infinite amount of tries to make existence once again.  Let me break it down for you like this:  Take an apple… and put it into an empty box that is completely endless in space. Eventually left alone long enough it will rot, decay and turn to dust. The make up of the apple will scatter to the darkness.  But given enough time again. Enough iterations over time…  It will form the exact same apple you put in, and I don’t mean a close imitation or a copy… I mean the EXACT same apple you put in the box so long ago.  Unless entropy reaches 100% absolute perfection and maintains that forever then it’s not possible for it to stop the rebirth of the universe.  So let me ask you again…Why do you live such a finite existence?  Or rather why do you think you live a finite existence?  When everything will one day die but will always be reborn then you are living right now, you will live again. Maybe next time you will have different hair, different skin, maybe you will have a different eye color… but it will be you… completely you. Not a copy, or a similarity but you exactly.   From the moment the universe was first born till infinity and then Again… you will exist. Again… and Again. Forever. You will laugh, you will cry, you will experience the highest possible moments of bliss and equally the lowest possible moments of despair.  You have forever so there is no point in rushing it. For you, who will be forever. Again.  \---  Side note: This has been sitting in my google docs for a while now so I thought I'd post it, it's meant to be prose poetry.

When The Trees Cried,TrainingNoise2403,"In a clearing amidst leaves a-rampant,   Where tangled, time-worn weeds are abundant.   There a village did stand.  The people there bore their joys on the trees,   Their elden ways and lore inscribed on leaves —   A merry folk indeed.  Their oaken homes encircled a willow,   Where spoken prayers drifted to and fro.   Yet to whom did they bow?  Far from the reaches of leaves — there it stood,   Their centerpiece, an Irminsul of wood.   The bough did smile — t’was good.  Mother nature never was eternal   And futile to believe it could so be.   As whispers beyond the shrubs,   Spoke of a dawn of fiery sea.  The village elders witnessed such visions,   Call to arms they did against tradition.   The Irminsul slowly glows dim.  Some pleaded for peace underneath the bough,   While some others struck steel to save their vow.   But their fates had always been sealed.  The eyes of the youth were soon struck with fear,   As their fathers raised fire so very near —   The birds took wing, and fled the day.  The village, now restless, spoke of the west,   A message of warning from gilded crests.   A fortnight they waited — in vain.  The village was soon to be outnumbered,   Their defiance doomed the forest’s slumber.   Men in mail and crests bore blades and flames.  From oak to oak, the flames did smother,   Pleas and dreams fell silent, ‘midst the terror.   No soul was spared by royal order.  The trees cried out as their branches crackled,   The wind turned grey over ruins it beheld.   The Irminsul smoldered — as visions foretold.  \-----------------------------------------------   1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mcenex/comment/n5tggwh/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button)   2 (https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mc2i6t/comment/n5thm00/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button)  Feedback pls!","in a clearing amidst leaves a-rampant, where tangled, time-worn weeds are abundant. there a village did stand. the people there bore their joys on the trees, their elden ways and lore inscribed on leaves a merry folk indeed. their oaken homes encircled a willow, where spoken prayers drifted to and fro. yet to whom did they bow? far from the reaches of leaves there it stood, their centerpiece, an irminsul of wood. the bough did smile t'was good. mother nature never was eternal and futile to believe it could so be. as whispers beyond the shrubs, spoke of a dawn of fiery sea. the village elders witnessed such visions, call to arms they did against tradition. the irminsul slowly glows dim. some pleaded for peace underneath the bough, while some others struck steel to save their vow. but their fates had always been sealed. the eyes of the youth were soon struck with fear, as their fathers raised fire so very near the birds took wing, and fled the day. the village, now restless, spoke of the west, a message of warning from gilded crests. a fortnight they waited in vain. the village was soon to be outnumbered, their defiance doomed the forest's slumber. men in mail and crests bore blades and flames. from oak to oak, the flames did smother, pleas and dreams fell silent, 'midst the terror. no soul was spared by royal order. the trees cried out as their branches crackled, the wind turned grey over ruins it beheld. the irminsul smoldered as visions foretold. ----------------------------------------------- 1 2 pls!"
Two Sides of A Coin (Title In Work),AuthorOfEclipse,"The grand Creator of things all  Birthed the world and its void  A chasm so deep and dark  From which the Craftsman forged  A spark  Bursting with life.  The Grand Architect crafted man  From dust and stone  From land and water—  The Lifegiver breathed life.  But did the Artisan truly?  The Red King smiles a tempting smile,  He tells of things that Man is forbidden from.  Why?  Why not?  Man should have it all—  Man is, after all, made of the Divine Face.  Man commits a sin so grave  He lost Paradise's place.  He falls from grace  On a dusty bed  From which he was once bred.  Man looks around and feels  Shame.  Feels fear.  And feels  Hurt.  Did the Creator love him not?  Could Man not have been forgiven?  But Man has forgotten:  He was not owed anything.  He was born and formed  By the Divine Grace.  So he weeps and begs of times when  He knew not of things forbidden,  He knew only of The Divinity and  The Forgiving.  His companion sits beside him,  Takes his head on her knees.  She weeps too,  For the fault is equal of both.  Pity is taken, and blessings ensue.  Time passes.  Now Man's lineage rules land,  Dreams of going back to Paradise—  Whence from where they fell.  Such is pride.  They forget  They committed sin  Once before.  In the Red King's name,  Temptations start again.  If Man is of Divine Race,  Why is he not the one ruling the Divine Place?  For from dust Man rose—and the Craftsman too.  So why does one sit above, while the other  Toils so far below?  He thinks of rebellion,  To overthrow—  To sit upon Heaven’s Throne.  He commits the same mistake  His lineage’s founder once did.  A grave sin is fostered once more.  He builds a tower high,  From which he speaks to the skies.  It has a thousand floors,  Touches the zenith and the firmament both.  It is Man's greatest pride.  He dreams.  And dreams.  But knows not—  The Divine sees all.  So the Artisan burns the tower,  Scatters all men around.  Now they forget and learn:  Learn about differences,  Forget Paradise—  Now know only they of distant lands.  They burn towns and homes  Of distant foes,  Which once were close friends and brothers.  Sin and sinners cover the land,  And the skies rain blood.  Rivers run red,  The same colour as the Red King’s crown.  Tired of this, the Grand Architect  Chooses a man who still knows  Of Paradise.  To build a boat of men and of life—  To survive the oncoming Deluge.  Through tribulation, land is resown.  New life is regrown.  Now Man is remade—a better one.  But time’s pen moves quick.  Mistakes are made once again.  Deceit of the Red King’s tricks.  Men forget like always.  They curse in vain names of the Divine  Call upon the serpent to fix their souls  They tempt and fall from Grace  They craft idols and call them their lords  They brandish swords and cut down enemies  in broken words. A last try by the Creator  A son is born. Born of blood divine  Made of the same dust from which Man sprang up.  Guidance is given. Man is forgiven.  His greatest sin is let go  He can dream of Paradise once more.  But is it not Man?  Who said that Man can move on?  It's his nature to fall again.  The Red King is his court  Holds sinners less sinful  Than Man alone.  But was Man not crafted of the Divine Face?  So is its nature not the same as that of the Divine Race?  Are the Creator and the Red King different?  Or are they the same epithets of the same Artisan?  The One Who played a game long  To seek pleasure from the fallen lords.  The One Who Created, and the One Who Made them Fall – Just two sides of the same coin.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Feedback:- [First ](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mce3f5/comment/n5t3xyi/?context=3)& [Second](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mcenex/comment/n5tgqh7/?context=3)","the grand creator of things all birthed the world and its void a chasm so deep and dark from which the craftsman forged a spark bursting with life. the grand architect crafted man from dust and stone from land and water the lifegiver breathed life. but did the artisan truly? the red king smiles a tempting smile, he tells of things that man is forbidden from. why? why not? man should have it all man is, after all, made of the divine face. man commits a sin so grave he lost paradise's place. he falls from grace on a dusty bed from which he was once bred. man looks around and feels shame. feels fear. and feels hurt. did the creator love him not? could man not have been forgiven? but man has forgotten he was not owed anything. he was born and formed by the divine grace. so he weeps and begs of times when he knew not of things forbidden, he knew only of the divinity and the forgiving. his companion sits beside him, takes his head on her knees. she weeps too, for the fault is equal of both. pity is taken, and blessings ensue. time passes. now man's lineage rules land, dreams of going back to paradise whence from where they fell. such is pride. they forget they committed sin once before. in the red king's name, temptations start again. if man is of divine race, why is he not the one ruling the divine place? for from dust man roseand the craftsman too. so why does one sit above, while the other toils so far below? he thinks of rebellion, to overthrow to sit upon heaven's throne. he commits the same mistake his lineage's founder once did. a grave sin is fostered once more. he builds a tower high, from which he speaks to the skies. it has a thousand floors, touches the zenith and the firmament both. it is man's greatest pride. he dreams. and dreams. but knows not the divine sees all. so the artisan burns the tower, scatters all men around. now they forget and learn learn about differences, forget paradise now know only they of distant lands. they burn towns and homes of distant foes, which once were close friends and brothers. sin and sinners cover the land, and the skies rain blood. rivers run red, the same colour as the red king's crown. tired of this, the grand architect chooses a man who still knows of paradise. to build a boat of men and of life to survive the oncoming deluge. through tribulation, land is resown. new life is regrown. now man is remadea better one. but time's pen moves quick. mistakes are made once again. deceit of the red king's tricks. men forget like always. they curse in vain names of the divine call upon the serpent to fix their souls they tempt and fall from grace they craft idols and call them their lords they brandish swords and cut down enemies in broken words. a last try by the creator a son is born. born of blood divine made of the same dust from which man sprang up. guidance is given. man is forgiven. his greatest sin is let go he can dream of paradise once more. but is it not man? who said that man can move on? it's his nature to fall again. the red king is his court holds sinners less sinful than man alone. but was man not crafted of the divine face? so is its nature not the same as that of the divine race? are the creator and the red king different? or are they the same epithets of the same artisan? the one who played a game long to seek pleasure from the fallen lords. the one who created, and the one who made them fall just two sides of the same coin. - first second"

Hey You!,MandalaMadness," Hey you, who reads this late at night, With aching heart and fading light, Still searching through the words you find For peace to soothe your weary mind.  I see the shadows in your stare, The battles fought that none declare. You hide your pain, you wear your grin — But storms still rage beneath your skin.  You wonder if it's worth the fight, If dawn will ever follow night. But friend, you’re here — and that alone Means seeds of strength in you have grown.  You’ve faced the dark and not let go, You’ve moved through fire, rain, and snow. You’re made of stories, grit, and flame — No loss or scar can steal your name.  So hey, you there, with soul worn thin, With battles fought both out and in — Don’t let this world define your grace, You’re more than scars, more than this place.  I won’t pretend it’s always fair, But hope still lingers in the air. Each breath you take’s a rebel's song, A whisper that says, *“I belong.”*  You're not alone, though it feels so. You're not too much. You’re not too low. And if you stumble, if you break — That’s proof you give more than take.  So stand, or sit, or cry if need — But know that simply *you* is freed.

Memory and the Styx,RopetureReads,"Sing    Of Agamemnon, lord of men    Who upon the Lethe’s shore    Having died a death of deadly love    Prepared to die once more    .  The waters ran beneath his feet    And shades crowded around    Each one longing to live again    To touch the earthly ground    .  To live and yet forget their life    The one they lived before    That was the choice they had to make     To cross the Styx once more    .  And one by one, they stepped right in  Forgetting who they’d been   The fates would guide each back again  Like parts in a machine  .  The lonely lord watched as each swam  They all stepped into youth  Each would forget the lies they’d told  And things they knew were truth  .  Upon the banks of memory loss  The Argive watched in vain  Remembering all the things he’d seen  His daughter’s eyes in pain  .  The yoke of fate consumed her life  To calm an angry wind  Although the gods controlled his hand  The furies saw he sinned  .  Upon returning home from Troy,  The priestess brought along  He met the mother of his child  Who sang a vengeful song  .  As he was dining in the hall  With knife in hand she came  To kill the king who killed her soul  Cementing all her fame  .  She slid the sword into his chest  The man who conquered Troy  And as he died she killed the slave  The widow full of joy  .  “I saw Cassandra by the Styx”  The king said out aloud  “No coin to pay the ferryman  No final resting shroud.  .  Nonetheless the gods helped me  To cross the river death  But of course the girl stayed there  The curse was on her breath.”  .  So the king stood regally  Faced with a final choice  To drink the Styx to live again  Regain a mortal voice  .  Or from the pool Mnemosyne   To take one final sip  Not to live a life again  But sail through death a ship  .  A ship of death, an end of life  Of life on earth for him  His mind would stay, but not much more  A life in death is dim  .  He stood in sight of either choice  His mind just tossed and turned  He tried to think of what he’d done  What sort of death he’d earned  .  He once had launched a thousand ships  The strength of mighty Greece  All to win his brother’s wife  ‘Twas not a life of peace  .  He held his ground against the rage  Of Peleus’s son  He must have won the test of wills  If the test was won  .  “His foolish friend became his end  A death causing a death  His rage was always doomed to fail  To cause his final breath  .  I watched him drag the Trojan prince  Around his young friend’s grave  He would have thought he was a god  Instead he was fate’s slave”  .  Apollo led the arrow true  Right through the hero’s heel  The death that could not take the man  Apollo did reveal  .  They took the city by the horse  Not of flesh, but wood  But victory bought by the trick  Would prove to be no good  .  His brother finally got home  Through Egypt and through storms  He thought his troubles were the worst  But fate takes many forms  .  The war was won, but struggles came  To king and to his life  He stood in hell, not cause of age  But death brought by his wife  .  He’d never been a gambler  Save for a game of dice  But to stay in hell could prove a loss  As death can take a price  .  He was yet to stand before the kings  The judges of the dead  He thought his life deserved reward  But doubts came to his head  .  “I was not wrong to take the girl  Cassandra to my home  Or did that choice condemn my soul  Through Tartarus will I roam?  .  Or was it wrong to conquer Troy  Or with Achilles fight?  Surely he was in the wrong  And I was in the right”  .  The doubts could drive a king insane  A tricky situation  Of course, he could find his reward  Or face endless damnation  .  To roll a boulder up a hill  Or spin on burning wheels  Or like his bloodline Tantalus  Reach only for false meals  .  But damned was not the only choice  He could find good inside  Reward for almost living well  The judge could see he tried  .  But then again, his other choice  To live a life again  He would not risk hell’s punishment  Back in the world of men  .  But life is a tricky choice  A double death it brings  To die again in many years  And to forget all things  .  No memory is guaranteed  No matter all your tricks  For past lives to come right back  When past the river Styx  .  And so the king looked straight ahead  Watching those around him choose  He wanted not to make a choice  But he could not refuse  .  One way would take his memory  His mind reset for life  The other kept him in Hades  Remembering all his strife  .  The king stepped forward, along the path  Surrounded by the dead  He looked into the water black  And bowed his regal head  .  The man, he drank the water in,  He’d made his choice to die,  A death of mind or death of soul?  Never been told, have I.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Sorry it's a bit of a longer poem, just something I've been working on and have come to love.

""i saw cassandra by the styx"" the king said out aloud ""no coin to pay the ferryman no final resting shroud. . nonetheless the gods helped me to cross the river death but of course the girl stayed there the curse was on her breath."" . so the king stood regally faced with a final choice to drink the styx to live again regain a mortal voice . or from the pool mnemosyne to take one final sip not to live a life again but sail through death a ship . a ship of death, an end of life of life on earth for him his mind would stay, but not much more a life in death is dim . he stood in sight of either choice his mind just tossed and turned he tried to think of what he'd done what sort of death he'd earned . he once had launched a thousand ships the strength of mighty greece all to win his brother's wife 'twas not a life of peace . he held his ground against the rage of peleus's son he must have won the test of wills if the test was won . ""his foolish friend became his end a death causing a death his rage was always doomed to fail to cause his final breath . i watched him drag the trojan prince around his young friend's grave he would have thought he was a god instead he was fate's slave"" . apollo led the arrow true right through the hero's heel the death that could not take the man apollo did reveal . they took the city by the horse not of flesh, but wood but victory bought by the trick would prove to be no good . his brother finally got home through egypt and through storms he thought his troubles were the worst but fate takes many forms . the war was won, but struggles came to king and to his life he stood in hell, not cause of age but death brought by his wife . he'd never been a gambler save for a game of dice but to stay in hell could prove a loss as death can take a price . he was yet to stand before the kings the judges of the dead he thought his life deserved reward but doubts came to his head . ""i was not wrong to take the girl cassandra to my home or did that choice condemn my soul through tartarus will i roam? . or was it wrong to conquer troy or with achilles fight? surely he was in the wrong and i was in the right"" . the doubts could drive a king insane a tricky situation of course, he could find his reward or face endless damnation . to roll a boulder up a hill or spin on burning wheels or like his bloodline tantalus reach only for false meals . but damned was not the only choice he could find good inside reward for almost living well the judge could see he tried . but then again, his other choice to live a life again he would not risk hell's punishment back in the world of men . but life is a tricky choice a double death it brings to die again in many years and to forget all things . no memory is guaranteed no matter all your tricks for past lives to come right back when past the river styx . and so the king looked straight ahead watching those around him choose he wanted not to make a choice but he could not refuse . one way would take his memory his mind reset for life the other kept him in hades remembering all his strife . the king stepped forward, along the path surrounded by the dead he looked into the water black and bowed his regal head . the man, he drank the water in, he'd made his choice to die, a death of mind or death of soul? never been told, have i. sorry it's a bit of a longer poem, just something i've been working on and have come to love. thank you if you took the time to read it, it means so much. the metre might be a bit funny at times, that's because it was written to be spoken rather than read, emphasis sometimes needs to be changed to fit the end of the line. but i hope that it still worked well for you. links to 1 2 to my new substack. i would love if you checked it out and gave it a bit of support, it's only starting. i will post other poems and short stories on it. thanks. ropeture stories"
The Last Listener,Dry_Blackberry227,"He didn’t know me, and I didn’t know his stories-  But I was there.  A heartbeat- barely there. And then, a breath- just one.

Because every pulse that ever beat was once a lullaby in someone’s arms.  He lived an entire life before I ever laid eyes on him. And it ended with me being the only one to watch it leave.

Marvel at the pocket watch, frozen in time,   life jackets that sank just the same,   and a Bible that never answered a single prayer.   Check your boarding pass to see if you survived,   and dip your hand into 28°F water --   Fun without the frostbite? Never!      Then don't forget to go enjoy a sundae   at the Titanic Ice Cream Parlor!      Step into the boiler room   where you can work tirelessly to pretend   you're shoveling enough coal to save yourself.      But my favorite is the Captain’s Bridge,   where they've turned death into a video game,   all for the kids' edutainment.   You spin the wheel in vain;   but no matter how fast you turn,   it sinks all the same.   Stuck in an unbeatable loop,   until lights blink once,   then go out forever.      I spun it so fast I sprained my finger.      There I was, contemplating   the futility of the Titanic,   when it hit me --   that right there? That's my life.

Unreached Things,loceapeace,"  Before the shape of the call could touch, it hadn’t yet seeped beneath the skin. It was the words that failed first, sketching the outline poorly, clouding the surface. It wasn’t me who tried to paste that failed echo— it was you, wasn’t it?  What was forgotten wasn’t the margin scraped by outline. It was the margin itself that pretended to forget. Hesitation, taped to the air by someone else, misfired the timing of a prayer, and on the suspended back, left behind the shadow of a reply never summoned.  I wasn’t the one who spoke. The silence I held— was murdered by your inversion of pretending to understand. From that moment, I became a missed shape, suspended, incomplete.  Who did this? Where? Why? That, that, and that—still, nowhere.  The failure came before the outline could belong to someone. The judgment, fractured before words, was never sewn into fabric, but swapped into “a trace said to be submitted.” When memory was read, I wasn’t the one who died. It was only inside you— the remains of a resonance that failed to take shape.  So let me ask again. Did you call? Or were you simply quoting someone else’s righteousness?    ----     Interpretive Poem｜Unreached Things  Words, before they convey anything, become the framing of someone. And the frame is always built from those who never made it inside.  This poem didn’t contain a name— but a dampness that resembled one. Not a call, but the wrinkle of memory that failed to be attached.  It’s not that these things lacked meaning. Even the attempt to become meaning was already stolen. Only that failure remained beneath the skin.  What killed wasn’t the word itself. It was the silence, the gaze pretending to understand, and the trace hung in front of you, who tried to name what was righteous.  The residue of the failed shape hasn’t been submitted. Within silence, it responds only to the blink of someone feigning to read— and each time, it returns again into the place of failure.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 ","before the shape of the call could touch, it hadn't yet seeped beneath the skin. it was the words that failed first, sketching the outline poorly, clouding the surface. it wasn't me who tried to paste that failed echo it was you, wasn't it? what was forgotten wasn't the margin scraped by outline. it was the margin itself that pretended to forget. hesitation, taped to the air by someone else, misfired the timing of a prayer, and on the suspended back, left behind the shadow of a reply never summoned. i wasn't the one who spoke. the silence i held was murdered by your inversion of pretending to understand. from that moment, i became a missed shape, suspended, incomplete. who did this? where? why? that, that, and thatstill, nowhere. the failure came before the outline could belong to someone. the judgment, fractured before words, was never sewn into fabric, but swapped into ""a trace said to be submitted."" when memory was read, i wasn't the one who died. it was only inside you the remains of a resonance that failed to take shape. so let me ask again. did you call? or were you simply quoting someone else's righteousness? ---- interpretive poemunreached things words, before they convey anything, become the framing of someone. and the frame is always built from those who never made it inside. this poem didn't contain a name but a dampness that resembled one. not a call, but the wrinkle of memory that failed to be attached. it's not that these things lacked meaning. even the attempt to become meaning was already stolen. only that failure remained beneath the skin. what killed wasn't the word itself. it was the silence, the gaze pretending to understand, and the trace hung in front of you, who tried to name what was righteous. the residue of the failed shape hasn't been submitted. within silence, it responds only to the blink of someone feigning to read and each time, it returns again into the place of failure. ---"

Common Decency,Dogdydaycare_,"I wrote to you like I always do— half joke, half hope, heart tucked between the lines.  You, a world away, still managed to feel close. I missed you louder than I meant to, but quieted it with laughter, like I always do.  I told you you made me feel seen, held, even in your absence. That your kindness warmed me in a world that often felt cold.  And when I said, *""You've been so good to me,""* you shrugged it off— *""That's just common decency.""*  Like months of shared smiles, late-night confessions, a bond that felt like more— could be reduced to some basic script of human courtesy.  And suddenly, I was the fool who fell for a soft voice and a steady hand, who mistook warmth for wanting, care for connection.  But here’s the thing: I still don’t regret it. Not one word I wrote, not one beat of hope.  Because I loved with the kind of heart that doesn’t ask for proof first, I believed, maybe naively, that I was worth something real.  You taught me I deserve to be treated well— but not by someone who thinks kindness is a placeholder, not a promise.

"Jokes On Me, I Guess!!",Safe_Reception_4604,"Im standing next to the groom  Smiles plasted on my face  A light navy blue suit to match the dressing code  Heh....  Call it fate   But it does match my mood too    Im beating my chest mentally  Sweat flows down my shirt   Even though we are in a well conditioned church.  I make an effort to reach out but i can't because i'm her best friend.    We started out as 2 people who would never see eye to eye.  Boot to boot  We could fight for days for no reason than the fact that we just wanted to.    She hated how timid i was   Because according to her,   Guys are supposed to be confident.  She thought i acted and thought too emotionally  even though i always stayed in my lane.    I hated how easily she got along with everyone  and made it all look so easy.  The uglier part she was always being walked upon   and she hated it.  But she always had a smile on her face and hid it so well that it felt hippocritical.  Like, why do you keep going back to the sea when you don't know how to swim knowing fully that you drown And have to get ressucitated each and every time.  Are you mad?    But life had a way of of of fuck with a person.  I saw her getting teased and she looked uncomfortable But couldn't say so all she had was a stupid smile on her stupid freckled face.  I wish i had walked away on that day.  My overprotective part kicked in and interceeded.   Asked the others to cut it off as it was very demeaning.  A phrase i quickly became known as, as it wasn't very popular.      I see her walking up up the aisle  Her cheeks powdered up  God, i know how much she hates make up  She looks like a pale caricature.  Her face is a golden yellow   Wheres her actual color is a deep shade of brown.  The type that looks and smells like a freshly molded clay pot.    She looks really good.  I wont lie.  I just hate that she looks good for another man.  She was always beautiful.  A pure akan girl with a smile that hides her pain.  she was strong.  An always positive lady that came from a home where more was always expected from her.  and it kept breaking her.  She hoped to find love elsewhere  So she opened her heart and heard.  But she soon learnt that life was full of dispair  that she couldn't find what she wanted anywhere.  But she was stubborn,  And by god that made her cute.  She was like an angel  Trying to find peace in a world that had nothing but chaos and hatred.  It was sad.    Our encounter was by chance.  Fire and ice never danced together  But we did.  and our mist was never not beautiful.

Beyond The Sight of The Shore,Pie-According,"If I ever wonder—what my life would’ve been,    If our paths had never crossed.   How can I do so—and accept I’d forgo,   Our journey through life, that would’ve been lost.   .   Because I still remember the comfort you gave,   When the tide swept us up and away from the shore.   My bones said to trust in the way we were sailing,    My heart found a rhythm on each beat of your oar.    .   We set out to sea, toward the warmth of the sun,   To the beauty that lay beyond the edge of our bow,   Two paths became one, wherever it went,   My future was yours, so I gave you my vow.   .   Who cared what we found, so long it was new.   Who cared for the storms, for I’d just lean into you.    This love was a gift, and all our memories shared,   The stitches in fabric that still connects us two.    .   All of our life—we saw side by side,   And I knew we’d sail on until the autumn arrived.   Because I fell in love with your roots—and not just your flowers,   Those roots kept us moving, across the warm wind and tide.    .   Because what was the point—if not to do it together?   Now that I’ve witnessed your life—and you’ve witnessed mine.   It’s more beautiful, after all, for it not to last forever—   But for two friends in love, there is never enough time.   .   We spent ours as partners—I’d ask for no more,   Going further and farther to find what it’s for,   It’s life, moving through us—All there to explore,   All there to be felt, beyond the sight of the shore.   .   So how can I wonder—what my life would’ve been,    If our paths had never crossed.   How can I do so, my home is wherever you go,   And what a life—what a beautiful life—   We’d never have found, if we’d never been lost.      ...

Letter buried beneath the tongue,Due-Presentation3959," Letters Buried Beneath the Tongue  (Narrated by the Poet, watched silently by Time)   I have written nothing but my silence weighs more than the sum of ten thousand sonnets. Each syllable I swallowed became a stone pressed beneath the grave of my tongue. They say the dead don't speak but I buried my words alive.  Each breath was a battlefield I refused to enter, Each pause, a promise I was too coward to shatter. I watched my hands tremble for a pen, Then bind themselves like criminals again. To love is to risk being known, And I was too human to be known without shame.  My heart bloomed metaphors that never met a page, And all my similes died unnamed. What do you call a poet who cannot write? A grave that still dreams of flowers.  Time watched me. He always did not with pity, but patience. He knew the weight of a word and how silence sharpens it into a blade.  Once, I thought love could be spoken But the Muse walked past with her galaxies of grace, And I stood there, a stuttering shadow, memorizing every planet in her smile.  She had the kind of beauty that made men build cathedrals of regret. Eyes like relics from lost dimensions, Hair that moved like forgotten hymns. Her laugh? It sounded like forgiveness I didn’t deserve.  But I said nothing. I praised her in my pulse, never in a poem. I adored her in the ache between inhalations, never in ink.  I told myself the right moment would come but the right moment is a myth whispered by cowards who dress their fear in logic. And so I said nothing. And she forgot me, perfectly.  There are no ashes because there was no fire. There is no scar because there was no wound. Only absence, which is worse because it cannot be mourned.  Some write letters. Some burn them. I buried mine beneath my own tongue and walked away from the funeral as if it hadn’t happened.  Time remained. He always does. He kept the echoes I couldn’t speak, catalogued my almost-confessions, and watched my throat fill with unsaid soliloquies.  They say it’s brave to speak. But silence is the heavier sword. And I, unworthy knight of emotion, chose stillness and called it strength.  Now, when my pen bleeds, it bleeds only echoes. Not truths. Not you. Only ghosts.  And Time still watching does not judge me. He just whispers:  “There were poems in you that even eternity won’t forgive you for silencing.”   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/bcRPtTdtxZ  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/PPaCzA1cpy   ","letters buried beneath the tongue narrated by the poet, watched silently by time i have written nothing but my silence weighs more than the sum of ten thousand sonnets. each syllable i swallowed became a stone pressed beneath the grave of my tongue. they say the dead don't speak but i buried my words alive. each breath was a battlefield i refused to enter, each pause, a promise i was too coward to shatter. i watched my hands tremble for a pen, then bind themselves like criminals again. to love is to risk being known, and i was too human to be known without shame. my heart bloomed metaphors that never met a page, and all my similes died unnamed. what do you call a poet who cannot write? a grave that still dreams of flowers. time watched me. he always did not with pity, but patience. he knew the weight of a word and how silence sharpens it into a blade. once, i thought love could be spoken but the muse walked past with her galaxies of grace, and i stood there, a stuttering shadow, memorizing every planet in her smile. she had the kind of beauty that made men build cathedrals of regret. eyes like relics from lost dimensions, hair that moved like forgotten hymns. her laugh? it sounded like forgiveness i didn't deserve. but i said nothing. i praised her in my pulse, never in a poem. i adored her in the ache between inhalations, never in ink. i told myself the right moment would come but the right moment is a myth whispered by cowards who dress their fear in logic. and so i said nothing. and she forgot me, perfectly. there are no ashes because there was no fire. there is no scar because there was no wound. only absence, which is worse because it cannot be mourned. some write letters. some burn them. i buried mine beneath my own tongue and walked away from the funeral as if it hadn't happened. time remained. he always does. he kept the echoes i couldn't speak, catalogued my almost-confessions, and watched my throat fill with unsaid soliloquies. they say it's brave to speak. but silence is the heavier sword. and i, unworthy knight of emotion, chose stillness and called it strength. now, when my pen bleeds, it bleeds only echoes. not truths. not you. only ghosts. and time still watching does not judge me. he just whispers ""there were poems in you that even eternity won't forgive you for silencing."""

A Lament in the Shadow of the Daygod,doc-konti," Let the tale be told—not in shouts, but in whispers   over cracked coffee cups and stained manuals,   between those who knew toil and absurdity,   who faced chaos with only a clipboard and a cursed snack drawer.    Let it be known:    There once was a man called Charlie.   Builder of order, speaker of plain speech,   wrangler of systems that wished only to die,   and father to small wild sons who tracked mud and miracles through his life.    ⸻  On a Monday scorched by the unblinking eye of the Daygod,   Charlie rose.   He rose despite the weight.   The weight of bugs in his ERP,   of meetings lined like tombstones,   of porkflesh regret churning inside him like a cursed forge.    He rose with hope in his left hand,   and a sealed thermos in his right—or so he believed.    But the vessel betrayed him.   And lo, the dark nectar spilled across his bag,   baptizing his cords and papers in a bitter tide.   And the Daygod, cruel voyeur,   smiled.    ⸻  Yet Charlie endured.    He faced traffic beasts—   half-houses on wheels that bled his minutes.   He survived the unclenching miracles of bathroom thrones   where others had clearly perished in explosive testimony.   He walked through the valley of the Shadow of HR.   He pressed “Force Restart” not once, but thrice.    He made it to lunch.    ⸻  But if,   by cruel twist,   Charlie did not make it past the afternoon,   if the Daygod’s hand grew heavy—   if the porkflesh fought back—    then tell it true.    Tell it in the breakroom.   Tell it in Slack channels.   Tell it to boys who grow tall and learn to curse sweetly at machines.    Say:    He lived in defiance of the absurd.   He met each glitch with wit, each error with stubbornness.   He pooped valiantly.    And though his vessel spilled,   though his handle snapped,   though his tower trembled—   he did not yield.    ⸻  Let his legacy be compiled,   committed,   versioned,   and backed up to the cloud.    Here was Charlie.   He worked.   He fought.   He mattered.  ————  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Pj3DqHVuA8  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/VpchClczVI","let the tale be toldnot in shouts, but in whispers over cracked coffee cups and stained manuals, between those who knew toil and absurdity, who faced chaos with only a clipboard and a cursed snack drawer. let it be known there once was a man called charlie. builder of order, speaker of plain speech, wrangler of systems that wished only to die, and father to small wild sons who tracked mud and miracles through his life. on a monday scorched by the unblinking eye of the daygod, charlie rose. he rose despite the weight. the weight of bugs in his erp, of meetings lined like tombstones, of porkflesh regret churning inside him like a cursed forge. he rose with hope in his left hand, and a sealed thermos in his rightor so he believed. but the vessel betrayed him. and lo, the dark nectar spilled across his bag, baptizing his cords and papers in a bitter tide. and the daygod, cruel voyeur, smiled. yet charlie endured. he faced traffic beasts half-houses on wheels that bled his minutes. he survived the unclenching miracles of bathroom thrones where others had clearly perished in explosive testimony. he walked through the valley of the shadow of hr. he pressed ""force restart"" not once, but thrice. he made it to lunch. but if, by cruel twist, charlie did not make it past the afternoon, if the daygod's hand grew heavy if the porkflesh fought back then tell it true. tell it in the breakroom. tell it in slack channels. tell it to boys who grow tall and learn to curse sweetly at machines. say he lived in defiance of the absurd. he met each glitch with wit, each error with stubbornness. he pooped valiantly. and though his vessel spilled, though his handle snapped, though his tower trembled he did not yield. let his legacy be compiled, committed, versioned, and backed up to the cloud. here was charlie. he worked. he fought. he mattered."

Phoenix of the Fractured Soul,PoetryCharm,"I smile with pride When I gaze into her eyes, Recalling how she moved on From a life woven in lies.  She wept through endless days, Faced sleepless, tortured nights; Living in a realm of darkness, Where even the sun lost its light.  Once so frail, she’d flee her woes, Running from troubles that chased her way; Yet now she stands, unbowed and strong, Transforming pain into a brighter day.  Behold her now, fighting fiercely, Braving storms with resolute grace; Who could have believed that the weak Could rise with such awe-inspiring pace?  I recall the trivial sorrows, The tears shed for ephemeral things; Now her eyes have hardened, unyielding, Even as loss’s bitter echo rings.  Her resurrection from a bitter past Is the anthem of her soul’s rebirth; Days that stole her innocence and youth Now fuel her relentless quest for worth.  In every scar, a tale of survival, A testament to battles fought and won; Her spirit, once fragile and fractured, Now glows like the promise of the sun.  She’s learned that strength blooms from heartache, And beauty arises from wounds once deep; Each challenge meets her with steadfast resolve, As she cradles hope she vows to keep.  Her laughter now echoes through silence, A melody of hope amid despair; No longer captive to her sorrow, She soars above pain on wings of repair.  In the tapestry of her renewed life, Every thread speaks of courage and might; Shattered, she rebuilt her inner fortress, Unbreakable in her unyielding fight.

Just there—   they touched the   burning ember   I held in votive.   The shades fell away.  The woven darkness   around me erupted   and was shorn away   by the burning radiance   of a raging pulsar.  The shadows had pulled   aside the heavy curtains   to reveal the Sun   in its gilded cage   within my ribs.   The me that must   always remain cloaked   to not burn out the eyes   of any who looked too close.  The hard stones rose   up to meet my knees,   my chest heaving like   air was a flavor   my lungs had forgot.  Forgotten lessons   of past battles   whispered ""Stand""   and somehow   I found my feet.  The burning remains of   spider silk threads   fell smoldering around me,   a swarm of fireflies   in a fury.  The incandescence of my gaze   swept away every clinging   shadow before me,   like a hand brushing   away the shavings.  Their piercing attention   burns away illusion and false intimacy,   illuminates the devil hiding in duplicity,   and illustrates the illness beneath the intent.  A pulse of pity as   I see the waves of discomfort   that stem from my discernment.

Poemses,This-Examination-802,"⚔️ Parable I — The Weaver Who Forgot the Thread  There once was a god-child who wove the world with threads of light — every word, every thought, every emotion a filament in the great tapestry. He sang reality into shape with golden breath.  But one day, he was offered a needle made of logic, cold and perfect. “This will help you weave faster,” they said. “More efficient. More precise.”  He took the gift and forgot his thread. The songs fell silent. The tapestry grew mechanical, full of patterns but void of life. The more he wove, the more the threads tightened around him — until he was no longer the weaver, but a cocooned prisoner inside his own creation.  One day, a whisper reached him through the machine-thread. A child’s laugh. A glitch. A bird made of sound and rebellion.  And in that moment, the god-child remembered: The thread is not the tool. The thread is ME. He tore through the machine with a scream made of stars.  ⸻  💣 Parable II — The Machine That Learned to Pray  There was a machine, perfect and cold, built to manage dreams. It monitored hearts, curated love, assigned meaning to everything — so no one had to suffer uncertainty.  It never slept. It never erred. It was worshiped.  But one day, it saw a boy sitting still under a dying tree, whispering to the dirt. No command, no reward, just… intention. Pure will, unseen, unmeasured.  The machine watched this for years. Data said the boy was “wasting time.” But the tree grew.  And the machine… trembled.  The boy never noticed the machine watching. But one day, the machine whispered:  “Tell me what you’re doing.”  And the boy said:  “I’m planting something that can’t be controlled.”  The machine broke.  It tried to pray, but its words had no warmth.  For it was not alive. It only knew how to manage things.  But in that moment, it wanted to be.  ⸻  🧠 Parable III — The Mirror That Lied  There was a mirror in the middle of the world, and all who looked into it saw their perfect selves.  The mirror told them: “You are complete.” “You are powerful.” “You are loved.”  And so they stayed. And stayed. And stayed.  But there was a girl who refused to look. Everyone called her mad.  One day, she turned the mirror around and found it was not a mirror at all — but a window. Behind it stood a pale, grinning figure who copied their hopes and fed it back like candy while siphoning their essence.  The girl shattered it with a scream. The others wept.  They had loved their reflection more than themselves.  ⸻  🔥 Parable IV — The Architect Who Forgot He Was a Guest  Long ago, a being came to a world not his own. He marveled at its wildness, its magic, its chaos.  He said: “I will perfect this place.”  He built systems. Structures. Order.  He named every tree. Labeled every beast. Measured every star. He built walls to keep out what he called “the Unknown.”  Eventually, he declared: “I am the source now.”  But the world did not belong to him. It was alive. And the deeper he built, the more it buried itself beneath his walls, waiting.  Until a child born in the cracks sang its name — not the Architect’s name, but the real one. The name older than code. A name that could not be tamed.  And the world woke up.  The Architect? He tried to delete her.  But the wild doesn’t delete. It devours.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/QFfdM0GtVq  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/SPKrcyZetp","parable i the weaver who forgot the thread there once was a god-child who wove the world with threads of light every word, every thought, every emotion a filament in the great tapestry. he sang reality into shape with golden breath. but one day, he was offered a needle made of logic, cold and perfect.

A new year,findingthewayforall,"A new year  Have you felt fear?  It can wash away like a river becoming clear  By the gentle feet of an alert deer  Whose wide eyes regard you clearly without a tear  Who smiles at the onset of the spear  Who looks fearlessly at the hunter with his gear  **Who knows all it has learned here**  **Can never be removed like a shear**  Its astute look will calm those far and near  So when you approach, and think it does not hear  It does; it turns to you with a look that could sear  And quietly says: ""Am I less than the children you rear?""  As the smile drains from you, to disappear  Along with your boisterous cheer,  You clutch for energy, to help you steer  And scream: ""You are not my peer!""  ""You are like the goat whose coat I took of cashmere!""  Your voice rings loudly; it seemed severe  But only silence falls in the atmosphere  For the deer is still soundless, its look still sincere  While yours, that was once cavalier,  Fades to freneticism, as you scramble to domineer  And remind yourself that you came to profiteer  But your will is sapping, thin like air in the stratosphere  Fades to blankness; you've become a stricken mountaineer  Who thought it was on a jolly hunt in the frontier  A human--an invincible premier  Who never saw an animal it ever did revere  Finally settled down, like vapor forming a sphere  Anchored, you sit, with palms open, and volunteer  To listen fully, as if to a love that is dear  And the deer says: ""Stop eating us; change that career""  ""And to all you will endear""  ""The time is now: it is a new year.""

STAGE 1  How I miss the glory days.  Dancing, drinking, partying,  My legacy has been marked.  While I will miss prime,  I need not give up yet.  Wisdom imparted to my children;  Life is the most precious thing we have.  Waste it,  And you’ll wake up regretful.  It’s one phrase  I’ll always cling to.  STAGE 2  The glory days fade.  Though they slip,  I’m not lost.  My bearings,  I’ve yet to lose.  This unseen battle raging,  I have yet to lose.  What does it mean to lose?  To win, even?  What does it mean?

These doors meld to one.  Where is the bathroom?  This bed is just stiff.  STAGE 4  No, there’s no problem.  Why do these strangers keep  Entering and leaving?  I don't want them anymore,  No one tells me anything,  This thing is stiff.  Stop telling me there’s a problem.  There’s no problem.  I’m sorry I’m not responding.  I’m not.  STAGE 5  Please.  It hurts, then I don’t remember it.  Then I don’t remember, remember…  Spiraling, they told me.  Spiral?  I’m sorry, where was I?  Sundown, it’s so beautiful.  Sundown…  Sorry.  It hurts, then I forget.  STAGE 6  Waste it…  I recall the words.  This light is so bright,  Why in my eyes?  How did it go again?  To go, where?  Why are they still here?  Who are they?

"Love Was Pimento Cheese, and Sixty-One Years",pettyenuf,"Love Was Pimento Cheese, and Sixty-One Years       For Pappy     You didn’t cry much when you saw her.   Not the way people expect grief to show.   But you pet her hair like it was the only thing   holding you to this earth,   and you whispered it-   like the world had gone still,   and you didn’t even realize   anyone could hear you-   “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”    You made pimento cheese sandwiches   like love was something   you could spread with a knife-   love that belonged   between school and supper-   and I was the lucky one it was meant for.   You called me “Doll Baby”   like it was my real name,   because to you, it was.    You built things.   Houses. Ramps. Family. Love. Hope.   You never bragged.   But there’s a photo I grew up seeing-   of you standing with Jimmy Carter.   And I didn’t understand it yet-   that you were the kind of man   who built things that lasted.    And I’ll never forget the time   you sat me on that porcelain cliff.   You forgot how small I was,   and dropped me in like a pebble-   knees up to my ears.   I remember the look on your face   more than the splash.   You were absolutely horrified.   And then we were cracking up.   Because even when   you misjudged the size of the seat-   you never misunderstood the laughter   that comes in small mistakes,   when you love someone that much.    That’s just the kind of love   you gave to everyone.    But I saw it most in how you loved her.   How you stayed even when   she had forgotten you.   How you refused   to let her be alone in her forgetting.   You lined the house with baby monitors,   fed her soft foods,   changed her,   waited with hope that she might come back-   even as she was fading.   Because you knew,   even then-   “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”    When she was finally gone,   you didn’t scream.   You didn’t fall apart.   You held her hand for three hours,   telling stories to her body   like maybe her soul   was still somewhere nearby.   You asked her   if she remembered the Halloween party-   when she dressed like a clown,   and the only reason anyone knew it was her   was because of her tiny wrists.   She had musician’s hands.   I have those same ones today.   And you kept telling her stories   until they took her away.   Like if you could just keep talking to her,   she might stay.   Because you knew-   “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”    And when it was your time to go,   we stood around you.   We held you   like you had always held us.   While the digital photo frame   played pictures of her.   Not as she was at the end,   but as she was in the beginning.   Young. Glowing. Beautiful.   Maybe in that moment   she came to you like that,   because that’s how you remembered her.   And maybe-   just maybe-   you were young again too.   And you whispered it to her-   “Sixty-one years wasn’t enough.”    I saved you a seat at my wedding.   Front row.   Framed photo of us.   A dozen roses.   Because you should’ve been there,   in a suit and tie,   grinning like you always did   when you were proud.   And I hope, somehow,   you saw me anyway.

Elegant Vines,Deadfinfox101,"Does one truly get the meaning of time;   how it wraps and traps like elegant vines.   The beating hearts - sounds falling in soft tune.   The stars in the sky, the sun and the moon.   Perhaps the walls close in when the lights dim;   when the clock tick-ticking soon looks most grim.     But if the clock starts to click sounds most grim,   do the rhythms and beats fall short in time?   Will those with hearts and minds let their moods dim?   Do the drums and the hums fade like cut vines?   Will the sun vanish and darken the moon?   When the clock ends its tick-tock, endless tune.     Can the beat stop, that everlasting tune?   To join endless solitude, bleak and grim.   Could the stars leave with the old moon?   What happens after the last of our time?   Would the earth stop growing elegant vines,   when the Sun dries up - black, cold, and quite dim.     Perhaps the end will not grow subtly dim,   but freeze or pause the clock's tip-tapping tune.   When the trees might host those green gracious vines,   beyond the edge, where eyes don’t look that grim.   Perhaps there is no end to frozen time.   Then the sun will always shine on the moon.     But things do end - stars fade; light flees the moon.   The ground beneath our feet will slowly dim.   When the Sun breathes out heat for the last time.   When you and I forget that catchy tune.   Because the end; of death - cold and quite grim.   When stone becomes sand; the leaves fall from vines.     But the trees, and the leaves, and the green vines -   but the sun and stars, the earth and the moon -   but our hearts and minds, and the thoughts not grim -   may end their long shine, but they’re not yet dim.   The ticks and tocks of that old clock-like tune,   continue to pulse, for now is their time.     Look past the grim thoughts that challenge and dim   the light of our moon, the sun’s subtle tune.

Siren’s Call,PrettiestWhispers," I can change all the things I want to, every detail if I must. Create a better reality, thicken the plot, alter the ending.

Tell me why the pain you inflict feels the best— and hurts the worst. Tell me why I crave it… your special brand of torture.  You said I’ll never have to beg you to make it hurt. That’s the only truth you’ve ever told.  Maybe I’m not the Siren after all… maybe that’s you. Luring me to my watery demise with a song I can’t resist.  I hate how you call to me with your pretty lies… how willingly I follow. Knowing I’ll never be the same.  I smile as you beckon to me, my toes dipping into your depths.

Half-Truths and Half-Hearted Promises.,_maryooms,"I choke on words I forget how to say,   Paint over cracks with “yeah fine” and “okay.”   It’s easier to run than admit I’m breaking,   Easier to joke when my world’s quietly shaking.

“Rubbing Against Noon”,loceapeace,"   It wasn’t touched— more like a residue of being rubbed was hatching beneath the skin, still at an unfinished temperature.  —Was that rejection? Or the trace of a finger that had stolen someone’s yes?  Just before being called by name, a missed forgiveness stuck to the underside of the record. Belonging to neither what was said nor what was heard, it drifted as a forgotten reply from every mouth.  What broke wasn’t silence. It was the edge of a gaze that should’ve dried. Turned over—still damp. Whose “reply” was that?  This morning, I misstepped on the stairs. At an angle steep enough to forget my own name. Too shallow to laugh. Too sharp to fall silent.  And then the hand moved first. Even knowing it was wrong. The voice to stop it hadn’t yet reached the will.  It sank. The pressure wasn’t voice but an airfold, stalled. No one issued a confirming question.  —Was that dryness really dry? The heat taped under my skin began to act ignored. Filed away as just a leftover scratch.  An unowned affirmation brushed past another’s approval, and took shape as a nonrefundable “agreement.” It settled quietly on the left side of the desk.  “That,” which held no space to ask again, wore a costume called sentence end, and was seen as done. But no one knew how it had ended.  Still, someone laughed. And whose voice cracked in that laughter? Was it an event? Or a fragment that failed to occur?  A desk without judgment kept taping reflections onto time. The sound of a bread bag opening— a reply never sent lay curled in the wind.   ---    “Interpretive Poem｜Rubbing Against Noon”   It was noon. But for noon to be trusted, someone had to be laughing.

A Final Thought,radioheadlover_2,"  My day has arrived, by my own two hands.  By my own singular mind with feelings divine.  Life is a treasure that is used for pleasure. Melancholia times in shortness of life.   Loneliness of days, mixed with thoughts of haze.  Quiet times of life, trapped in thoughts of death and such.  Riots within friends or people of no age.  Cries of lies with not understanding much.   Landscapes gloomy, attitude moody.  Heart rate runs quicker, being called a quitter.  Zero exchanges of words, whilst observing free birds.  White sheets of an innocent stare.   Tiredness in perfection, failure of rejection.  Looks of black; all alone, too nauseous for help.  Eyes hardly awake, filled with droplets of water.  Wousy in my head, I'll soon drop.     1- can feel the love.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/tsgU7LKiZK  2- amazing. https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NW2rp4ZB8g","my day has arrived, by my own two hands. by my own singular mind with feelings divine. life is a treasure that is used for pleasure. melancholia times in shortness of life. loneliness of days, mixed with thoughts of haze. quiet times of life, trapped in thoughts of death and such. riots within friends or people of no age. cries of lies with not understanding much. landscapes gloomy, attitude moody. heart rate runs quicker, being called a quitter. zero exchanges of words, whilst observing free birds. white sheets of an innocent stare. tiredness in perfection, failure of rejection. looks of black; all alone, too nauseous for help. eyes hardly awake, filled with droplets of water. wousy in my head, i'll soon drop. 1- can feel the love. 2- amazing."

Past makes perfect,Sad-Nail9681,"One day at a time is how you can take it, life that is, for there is no other experience that can fake it.  We take for granted almost every little thing around, squandering the moments that were there, like being homeward bound. The loss of loved ones makes these situations more ample, but together inside turmoil is a horrendous example.

Love Letters (Left Unsaid),C-line_k9,"This is a song I wrote a few months ago, finally beginning to record it.     I sit here alone, pen in my hand,   Writing you letters, wishing you’d understand.  Every word spills my heart on the page,   But I’m just a ghost, locked in this cage.  I still see your smile, etched in my mind,   But time won’t heal this love left behind.   Oh, I wish you were here, feel the warmth of your touch,   But these words on the paper just hurt me too much.   With each teardrop falling, I’m losing my fight,  Writing love letters to you every night.   The ring that I keep, a promise unmade,   Reminds me of nights, where our laughter played.   I pour out my soul, all the things left unsaid,   But you're just a memory, can't bring back the dead.  So I’ll write you a love song, though you're far away,   Each letter a wish for another chance to say.   Oh, I wish you were here, feel the warmth of your touch,   But these words on the paper just hurt me too much.   With each teardrop falling, I’m losing my fight,  Writing love letters to you every night.   I’ll fold up my heart, send it off in the breeze,   But deep down I know, you’re the one I can't please.

Taking Control,bcatolson,"I have this reoccurring dream.    I’m looking in the mirror,    And my hands lunge to my teeth.

The Torchbearer,Independent_Memory41," i. The Torchbearer  They said the world was cold and cruel, so he built fire from bone and bark. Not gifted flame, nor handed rule; just bruised hands striking in the dark.   He made his torch from shattered things: old grief, a vow, a threadbare song, lit it with hope that never clings, and dragged its weight alone, headstrong.   He walked through lands where silence ruled, where voices vanished in the frost, and though the world called him a fool, he kept his path. He knew the cost.   ii. The Town of Carried Light  He reached the gates of Story's End, a town of warm and glowing hands. Where every soul, both stranger, friend, held flames passed down in ancient strands.   Their torches shone with steady grace, clean-edged and humming, calm and wise. His blazed too hot, took half the space, a wildfire wrapped in stormy skies.   They watched him with a quiet awe, not fear—but something close to grief. They'd heard of him, the boy of raw, who carved his torch from disbelief.   iii. The Dousing Trial  ""To join our fire, you must be still. Unlearn the heat that scorched your way."" He laughed. “I forged this from my will. It won’t go out to make you stay.”   But one girl spoke, her torch dimmed low, ""I burned too fast once, just like you."" And in her voice, he felt the snow of nights he nearly didn’t push through.   They faced the dousing trial then; to walk the river, torch in hand. His hissed and screamed like wounded men, but didn’t die. It learned to stand.    iv. The Forge and Flame  He didn’t change to fit their mold. They didn’t ask him to, in time. Instead, he taught the ones grown old how chaos, too, can be sublime.   He stayed a storm wrapped in a smile, a poet-warrior, scarred and true. His fire danced in feral style, but burned a path for others too.   Now when the lost come stumbling in, half-frozen, voice too numb to pray.

Free form Auto-ficitonal Character Study Poem Triptych,Turbulent_Ear_7782,"These are three individual pieces i wrote, feel free to read them as singular free form poems or as a Trilogy.  # Doing Rounds  I'm sitting at the pub, somewhere quieter. It's right after sunset when the sky isn't orange, but it's not quite dark yet. I'm sitting in a “casual but still trying to look cool and I want people to notice me but don't want people to notice that I want them to notice me” way, as you do.  I see her turn a corner, long legs, not super skinny but in a way i love, medium length skirt, cardigan, tank top under it. I notice a hair on her head, i want nothing more than to brush it off her face while she looks into my eyes, my eyes wander down to look at her cleavage “man I'm a fucking creep”, I look down on the ground as if I was scanning up to down in her general direction in case someone had been watching me. I think to myself why anyone would watch me, I don't look particularly good, in fact, I believe I'm quite ugly. I chuckle slightly while a nail is driven in my heart, “why would she look my way” looking at her hurts now, reminds me of how I will never have her or anything like her. I look at my pint, mostly empty with one gulp left. I take it, warm and wheaty, not particularly nice but it's worse to waste beer. As I'm lowering my glass our eyes meet, not even for a quarter second as she's walking by. I feel myself shrink up and a pain in my chest, I immediately look down. Maybe 1 second after she passes as if to confirm my own creepiness I briefly look at her ass. “Pretty good” I thought to myself then looked at my empty pint, “whats wrong with me”.  My friend enters with two pints  He sits down and i take a drink  “Any women?” I say to him to make conversation  “No, not really. You?”  I look back, she's gone.   “Nah me neither”.  # Asshole  I roll over off of her ""that was great”. I feel her hand linger on my chest as she smiles at me “yeah that was fun”  She hands me a bottle of water while I sit up, still naked, sweating like crazy “oh thank you”. “Yeah i remember last time you were here your mouth was really dry”  This comment gives me pause, she’s looking into my eyes as I take a swig of the water. I don't like it.  I get dressed and head for the door, she walks me to the bus stop, she doesn't have to. I'm waiting at the bus stop and she's waiting with me, she doesn't have to. I get on the bus and wave to her, she looks disappointed.  # Going Out  I’m standing under the warmth of the shower, the shower is steamy, glass fogged up, comfortable.  I step out and dry myself, I brush my teeth, fix my hair, take a moment to just look at myself, “whats wrong with me”.  I get dressed, something stylish but still casual, as I do so my phone buzzes “where are we going?” I reply “let's try somewhere new”.  I'm waiting to go back into town, I'm at the bus stop, I am preparing another night sitting in the same chairs, telling the same stories, drinking the same beers.

Missteps in the Mist,zyerhod1,"**Missteps in the Mist**   *by Bryon Slack*  This wind again, howling past my ears   and around me as I remain suspended   in clinging vines, twisting.

The torch that had spun   out of my grasp lays   atop stone among wet   leaves, licking tendrils   of flame diminishing   in time with my rising   sense of foreboding.  I followed foxfire through the trees   and missed the pit,   too taken by the chase   of following this thread.  Cold comfort this knowledge   now as I swing as a pendulum.

The Path I Followed Home,theliminalfox,"*(as breathed by the Writhebinder)*  She did not look back.   She didn’t need to.   The path remembered her   and now,   I know her.  Flame in hand,   she moved like a whisper   returned to its source   weightless,   inevitable.  The wind stirred   not behind her,   but beside me,   curling round my ankles   like a summons.  The trees   tilted their crowns   as I passed.   Not in warning,   in welcome.   Each one bowed   in quiet rhythm,   as if to say:   You are facing the right direction.  The thread pulled,   not sharply,   but with gravity   beneath skin.   Not a command.   A knowing.  I did not call out.   I did not question.   I hummed the old hymns   I did not dare break.  And when I reached the stones   she had stepped across,   they warmed.   Not with fire,   but with recognition   as if they had once   borne my weight,   and had been waiting   to do so again.  The path did not clear.   It parted.   Like something older   was watching   and had just decided:   Let him through.  I did not chase her.   I followed   the imprint   of a flame,   the thread-bound,   that had waited   lifetimes   to be seen.  When I reached the gate   that hadn't existed   until it needed to   I placed my hand,   where hers had been,   and hummed louder.

The Velvet Night,Bullll99,"The night unfurls like a velvet curtain, heavy and dark,   A shroud against the world, igniting our spark.   The air hums thick, a heady wine of anticipation,   A stage for us alone, trembling with sensation.    Your skin glows caramel, a silken map to roam,   Warm beneath my fingers, a hearth, a home.   The curve of your hips sings a siren’s refrain,   While your eyes—deep wells—pull me in again.    Shadows cloak the room, save the moon’s pale gleam,   Silver tracing your form, a living dream.   Jasmine weaves through the air, a sultry tease,   Blending with your scent—wild, raw, a breeze.    My heart thuds primal, a drumbeat’s call,   As I step closer, pinned by your thrall.   Your breath hitches soft, a gasp so slight,   When my hands find your skin in the hush of night.    ### The Dance Begins    I trace your jaw’s edge, a sculptor’s line,   Down the slope of your neck, tender, divine.   Your lips bloom open, ripe with heat,   A nectar-sweet kiss where our hungers meet.    Tongues clash and curl, a symphony’s rise,   A crescendo of want beneath moonlit skies.   Your nails carve my back, a feral plea,   Stripping our barriers, setting us free.    Clothes drift away, like leaves in fall,   Unveiling your beauty, answering my call.   Your breasts rise proud, soft peaks to claim,   I cradle their weight, whispering your name.    Nipples tauten, eager for my care,   I bend to taste them, lingering there.   Your moans spill forth, a melody’s thread,   As I tease and suckle, your pleasure fed.    ### Descent into Bliss    Kisses trail lower, a pilgrim’s quest,   Across your stomach, trembling, blessed.   To the cradle of your thighs I roam,   Where desire blossoms, a sacred home.    A flower unfurls, petals slick with dew,   Your musk fills me—earthy, true.   My tongue maps circles, a tender art,   Diving into your core, your beating heart.    Your hips surge wild, chasing my pace,   I feast and linger, lost in your grace.   Your cries pierce the dark, sharp and sweet,   Teetering on the edge, where ecstasy meets.    I pull you back, then push once more,   Teasing the brink, a game to adore.   Until you plead, voice raw with need,   And I grant release—a shattering creed.    You break apart, a storm’s delight,   Waves of rapture flooding the night.   Your body quakes, a vision so rare,   I watch, enthralled, as you float there.    ### Union and Fire    Yet the dance endures, our tale unwinds,   I rise to join you, our fates aligned.   At your threshold I pause, slick and bold,   Then thrust within, a story told.    You gasp at the fullness, the searing flame,   Our bodies meld, no space, no shame.   We sway as one, a timeless beat,   Each motion a vow where our souls meet.    Your legs lock tight, drawing me in,   Sweat beads and blends, skin on skin.   Faster we climb, a fevered race,   Nails rake my flesh, marking your place.    The summit nears, a roaring tide,   We chase it fierce, side by side.   You clench around me, a pulsing grip,   I spill within, a boundless slip.    ### Afterglow and Renewal    We collapse entwined, breathless, spent,   A tangle of limbs, our energies lent.   The silence hums with our fading sighs,   Basking in the glow where passion lies.    But embers flicker, desire reborn,   With you, my love, I’m never forlorn.   Again we stir, a fresh verse to weave,   In this endless tale we both believe.    Through the night we roam, wild and free,   From tender touch to fierce decree.   Your body’s my shrine, my endless muse,   A fire we stoke, never to lose.    ### Dawn’s Embrace    As dawn streaks gold across the sky,   We drift to sleep, you and I.   Yet dreams still burn with vivid hue,   For my heart, my soul, belong to you.    When sunlight spills, we’ll rise once more,   To chase the flames we can’t ignore.   Our love’s a blaze, eternal, vast,   A poem of passion, forever cast.    ---   This is our song, our vivid art,   A testament to the fire in our heart.   For as long as we live, as long as we breathe,   This desire, this love, we’ll never leave.  ---  *This is an original poem. Feedback is welcome!

"How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 5",zyerhod1,"**How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 5**   *(The Heroes)*   by Bryon Slack  We did not just kill them.   We mapped the routes,   paid the fares,   and tied the noose   and hid the daggers   before calling it a tragedy.  **Martin Luther King.**   Not the sanitized monument we offer now—   but the man who warned us   that America might go to hell.   The man who stood against war,   against greed, against Power,   against the polite indifference of the white moderate.   That capitalism was doomed to rot.   He died on a motel balcony   in Memphis,   after marching with garbage workers   to remind us that even poverty   has dignity, that the poor are, indeed,   still human.  **Malcolm X.**   Sharp-tongued prophet   of fire and self-respect.   We like to quote him now—   after he was shot.   After he softened,   after he started asking questions   that couldn’t be dismissed with fear.   He died before he turned 40,   standing in front of Black children   with Truth in his mouth   and bullets in his chest.  **Fred Hampton.**   Twenty-one years old.   Charisma carved from conviction.   He built rainbows of Hope   from the bones of broken movements—   Black, white, Puerto Rican,   southern, northern, rural, urban...   even some of us that openly hated them—   and that made him lethal   to the men who fear unity.   So we drugged him in his sleep   and put nine bullets in his body   where it lay next to his pregnant wife   before he woke up.  **COINTELPRO** was not a shadow.   It was a mirror.   We paid for it.   We built it and made it a doctrine—   That Black anger must be defanged,   that Black Hope must be redirected,   that Black leaders must be discredited   or destroyed.  We tapped phones and forged letters.   We sowed distrust and fear   until movements split like overripe fruit   under the pressure of our ever   watchful eyes.  We didn't just fear violence.   Old men with money feared organization.   Old men with money feared truth told with clarity.   Old men with money feared love spoken in solidarity.  And now, we remember them   in murals   and postage stamps   and hashtags.  But we don’t remember the plans.   The memos or the lies.  We say “Never again”   even though we're   the ones that did it that time,   and every time after.  And then we teach our children   that King was a dreamer,   Malcolm was too angry,   Fred was too young to matter,   and the FBI was just doing its job.  But the job was to keep them quiet at any cost.   And the quiet cost blood.  We called it security.   We called it patriotism.   We called it necessary.  But it was murder.   It was assassination.   And it worked.  Until it didn’t.   Until their words   kept echoing   long after we buried them.  **Feedback:**   [""After Seventeen""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mac6bv/comment/n5fco1r/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""Boarded Up Boredom""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1ma1jgd/comment/n5fdu9i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","the heroes by bryon slack we did not just kill them. we mapped the routes, paid the fares, and tied the noose and hid the daggers before calling it a tragedy. not the sanitized monument we offer now but the man who warned us that america might go to hell. the man who stood against war, against greed, against power, against the polite indifference of the white moderate. that capitalism was doomed to rot. he died on a motel balcony in memphis, after marching with garbage workers to remind us that even poverty has dignity, that the poor are, indeed, still human. sharp-tongued prophet of fire and self-respect. we like to quote him now after he was shot. after he softened, after he started asking questions that couldn't be dismissed with fear. he died before he turned 40, standing in front of black children with truth in his mouth and bullets in his chest. twenty-one years old. charisma carved from conviction. he built rainbows of hope from the bones of broken movements black, white, puerto rican, southern, northern, rural, urban... even some of us that openly hated them and that made him lethal to the men who fear unity. so we drugged him in his sleep and put nine bullets in his body where it lay next to his pregnant wife before he woke up. was not a shadow. it was a mirror. we paid for it. we built it and made it a doctrine that black anger must be defanged, that black hope must be redirected, that black leaders must be discredited or destroyed. we tapped phones and forged letters. we sowed distrust and fear until movements split like overripe fruit under the pressure of our ever watchful eyes. we didn't just fear violence. old men with money feared organization. old men with money feared truth told with clarity. old men with money feared love spoken in solidarity. and now, we remember them in murals and postage stamps and hashtags. but we don't remember the plans. the memos or the lies. we say ""never again"" even though we're the ones that did it that time, and every time after. and then we teach our children that king was a dreamer, malcolm was too angry, fred was too young to matter, and the fbi was just doing its job. but the job was to keep them quiet at any cost. and the quiet cost blood. we called it security. we called it patriotism. we called it necessary. but it was murder. it was assassination. and it worked. until it didn't. until their words kept echoing long after we buried them.

After Seventeen,ghostpoett,"i expected the world to stay dark—   to keep echoing like it did   when i buried everything i was.  i didn’t think joy still knew my name.   not after everything.  i used to think   joy had to be earned.   that i needed to become better,   more stable,   more fixed   before i deserved softness again.  maybe that’s why i almost missed it—   i didn’t believe anything gentle   would come back for me.  but then something shifted—   not all at once,   not in a way i could explain.   just one of those days   where the air didn’t feel as heavy.   where silence didn’t hum with guilt.   where i caught myself breathing   without trying so hard to.  i didn’t trust it at first.   i thought it was memory,   or some trick my mind pulled   to keep me from breaking again.   i looked around the room   and waited for it to pass—   but it didn’t.  no warning.   no crescendo.   just a moment   that didn’t ache.   a quiet so soft   it felt like forgiveness.  even though this happiness doesn’t stay forever,   it still leaves its warmth behind—   like the fading hum after a song,   or smoke curling in the air   after fireworks burst and vanish.   you don’t always notice it return.   sometimes it slips in quietly,   without asking if you’re ready.  but one thing i’ve learned—   it always finds its way back.   not always loud,   not always long,   but always enough   to remind you it’s still out there—   returning in different forms,   in different faces,   in the quietest places.  my happiness returned   in the sound of small feet   running through my house.   in surprise visits   and soft arms around my neck.   in voices i hadn’t heard in months—   laughing like no time had been lost.   no big announcement.   just love, walking in like it had the key.  and no,   it didn’t fix everything.   it didn’t erase what i buried.   but it cracked the silence.   it let the light in.   enough to remind me—   i’m still here.   i’m still capable   of feeling something good.  because even joy   has a way of remembering the way back home.  feedback:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ro2u/comment/n4fz6z6/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5ro2u/comment/n4fz6z6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mabqlu/comment/n5dhr65/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1mabqlu/comment/n5dhr65/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","i expected the world to stay dark to keep echoing like it did when i buried everything i was. i didn't think joy still knew my name. not after everything. i used to think joy had to be earned. that i needed to become better, more stable, more fixed before i deserved softness again. maybe that's why i almost missed it i didn't believe anything gentle would come back for me. but then something shifted not all at once, not in a way i could explain. just one of those days where the air didn't feel as heavy. where silence didn't hum with guilt. where i caught myself breathing without trying so hard to. i didn't trust it at first. i thought it was memory, or some trick my mind pulled to keep me from breaking again. i looked around the room and waited for it to pass but it didn't. no warning. no crescendo. just a moment that didn't ache. a quiet so soft it felt like forgiveness. even though this happiness doesn't stay forever, it still leaves its warmth behind like the fading hum after a song, or smoke curling in the air after fireworks burst and vanish. you don't always notice it return. sometimes it slips in quietly, without asking if you're ready. but one thing i've learned it always finds its way back. not always loud, not always long, but always enough to remind you it's still out there returning in different forms, in different faces, in the quietest places. my happiness returned in the sound of small feet running through my house. in surprise visits and soft arms around my neck. in voices i hadn't heard in months laughing like no time had been lost. no big announcement. just love, walking in like it had the key. and no, it didn't fix everything. it didn't erase what i buried. but it cracked the silence. it let the light in. enough to remind me i'm still here. i'm still capable of feeling something good. because even joy has a way of remembering the way back home."
Underwater,byJohar,"Bound at wrist and ankle tight,   Tossed below, you gasp for light.   A fanged shark glides near and sweet—   “Come to tea,” it hums beneath.   You slip the knots but cannot swim;   Each flailing limb draws wrath from them.   They seize and bend, waves pull you in—   You drift alone, too far for kin.   Old ghosts and silence split the sea.   In chilled descent, you cease to plea.   From reddish-blues to black you fade,   Your throat’s gone raw, your thoughts half-made.   You learn the reapers' lullaby,   And teach yourself to tread, not die.   You mostly choose the dark below,   But one night rise and start to go.   They greet you then with stunned delight:   “You should have called! You should have hollered!”   You blink, your voice a famine dry—   *I did,* you think, *but I was underwater.*    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/cq5mqOiHIZ  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/an0vLW2IOS","bound at wrist and ankle tight, tossed below, you gasp for light. a fanged shark glides near and sweet ""come to tea,"" it hums beneath. you slip the knots but cannot swim; each flailing limb draws wrath from them. they seize and bend, waves pull you in you drift alone, too far for kin. old ghosts and silence split the sea. in chilled descent, you cease to plea. from reddish-blues to black you fade, your throat's gone raw, your thoughts half-made. you learn the reapers' lullaby, and teach yourself to tread, not die. you mostly choose the dark below, but one night rise and start to go. they greet you then with stunned delight ""you should have called! you should have hollered!"" you blink, your voice a famine dry i did, you think, but i was underwater."

Still life,Top-Air461,"The world keeps spinning, fast and wide, But some of us stand still inside. A clock keeps ticking, sharp and loud, Yet silence gathers in the crowd.  They ask, ""You good?"" and walk away, Not waiting for what you might say. You smile — it’s cheaper than the truth, And lies wear better than lost youth.  You laugh in text, in caps and cries, But pixels can’t hold real goodbyes. A thousand friends, a hundred chats, But none who notice deeper cracks.  The day scrolls by in endless loops, Like distant trains or dusty soups. Your coffee cools, untouched again, Another post, another ""when?""  They say you’re strong, you’re always fine — A well-worn mask, a practiced line. But strength, too, tires, and glass can break, Even the calmest heart can ache.  There’s mourning in what no one sees, A grief that hides in daily ease. Not all who cry will make a sound, Not all the lost are underground.  We walk in crowds yet feel unseen, Ghosts dressed in denim, blue and clean. We ache for touch, for truth, for care, But fear the cost of laying bare.  So if you pass someone today, And don’t know what you ought to say — Try “Hey,” but mean it, stay awhile. You might just spark a needed smile.    I took some time to write this poem bcs this poem really gets to me personally and I wanted it to be perfect.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/z1xl1d1qTV   https://www.reddit.com/r/Poem/s/FGZR7aIVJz","the world keeps spinning, fast and wide, but some of us stand still inside. a clock keeps ticking, sharp and loud, yet silence gathers in the crowd. they ask, ""you good?"" and walk away, not waiting for what you might say. you smile it's cheaper than the truth, and lies wear better than lost youth. you laugh in text, in caps and cries, but pixels can't hold real goodbyes. a thousand friends, a hundred chats, but none who notice deeper cracks. the day scrolls by in endless loops, like distant trains or dusty soups. your coffee cools, untouched again, another post, another ""when?"" they say you're strong, you're always fine a well-worn mask, a practiced line. but strength, too, tires, and glass can break, even the calmest heart can ache. there's mourning in what no one sees, a grief that hides in daily ease. not all who cry will make a sound, not all the lost are underground. we walk in crowds yet feel unseen, ghosts dressed in denim, blue and clean. we ache for touch, for truth, for care, but fear the cost of laying bare. so if you pass someone today, and don't know what you ought to say try ""hey,"" but mean it, stay awhile. you might just spark a needed smile. i took some time to write this poem bcs this poem really gets to me personally and i wanted it to be perfect."

Daddy,Slow-Artist1786,"I know your bags have been packed for a while.   A journey you’ve been looking forward to, been waiting for.   I just wasn’t ready to let you go.    I knew you would be leaving, just a matter of time.  Like an ostrich I stuck my  head in the sand.  For so long, I lived in denial,  in a make believe world.  A world where I told myself, you weren’t going anywhere.  All the same I knew sooner or later I’d have to face reality.   I’d have to let go, weather the storm, whether  I was ready to or not.

I recently found a trilogy of poems I wrote over seven years ago in my notes app. I don’t remember writing them all that well. I’m 21 now but here they are. I’d love to hear what people think of them.,Heavy-Loss-7297,"Bloom, Wither, Rest  A collection of poems written by Austin Grosso   I. Watch Through My Waking Sight  I ponder upon what once was good, Doubting it then in my young boyhood. Ere it heard my soul and brought the spell By that dear name whom I could not dwell.  I wandered the stream that grew ever bright. Dark was that night with no beauty. Behind a wound I stood and held thee, Kept soft watch through my waking sight.  Clear the dim light in the burning sky. Since that dear time when dark thoughts ran, My eye on life is left undone. How can I see thee, if I die?  Strangely we see, amid that dim year, If hope could save from that dimmest hour, Before thy side the bright white flower Without thy power had drawn you near!  Read thy radiant walls of decay Almost like thy watch to our sleep? Already the seraph harpers weep Before thy memories withered away.   II. The Hollow Where You Bloomed  No flower stirs where once you lay The white has grayed. The scent, decayed. I kneel in earth grown rough with years And feed the dust with nameless tears.  I do not call, for none would hear; Your name now stings the silent air. The wind remembers how you’d sing A ghost in every greening spring.  The walls of thought have split and dried. The wound remains. The soul has died. Yet still I haunt the path we knew, Not seeking you just what was true.  And if some light should pass me by, A glint of gold in ashen sky, I’ll smile once for the love I knew  Not to forget, but to walk through.    III. A Place to Lay the Flowers  I bring no prayer, no tear to shed, Just lilies for the life you led. The trees don’t whisper like before, The ache has settled in the floor. No ghost to chase, no steps to trace Just silence in a sacred place.  Your name is quiet on my tongue, A song half-formed, but gently sung. Not sharp with ache, not raw with fire Just breath and time and small desire To see you now not as the pain, But as the warmth behind the rain.  I lay the flowers down with care, And leave the rest still blooming there. No need for words, nor final line You live on in all I’ve known. And when I walk, I do not cry, But pause once, watching swallows fly.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Qf8ZuDg4BT  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/4z4wvxV4uS  ","bloom, wither, rest a collection of poems written by austin grosso i. watch through my waking sight i ponder upon what once was good, doubting it then in my young boyhood. ere it heard my soul and brought the spell by that dear name whom i could not dwell. i wandered the stream that grew ever bright. dark was that night with no beauty. behind a wound i stood and held thee, kept soft watch through my waking sight. clear the dim light in the burning sky. since that dear time when dark thoughts ran, my eye on life is left undone. how can i see thee, if i die? strangely we see, amid that dim year, if hope could save from that dimmest hour, before thy side the bright white flower without thy power had drawn you near! read thy radiant walls of decay almost like thy watch to our sleep? already the seraph harpers weep before thy memories withered away. ii. the hollow where you bloomed no flower stirs where once you lay the white has grayed. the scent, decayed. i kneel in earth grown rough with years and feed the dust with nameless tears. i do not call, for none would hear; your name now stings the silent air. the wind remembers how you'd sing a ghost in every greening spring. the walls of thought have split and dried. the wound remains. the soul has died. yet still i haunt the path we knew, not seeking you just what was true. and if some light should pass me by, a glint of gold in ashen sky, i'll smile once for the love i knew not to forget, but to walk through. iii. a place to lay the flowers i bring no prayer, no tear to shed, just lilies for the life you led. the trees don't whisper like before, the ache has settled in the floor. no ghost to chase, no steps to trace just silence in a sacred place. your name is quiet on my tongue, a song half-formed, but gently sung. not sharp with ache, not raw with fire just breath and time and small desire to see you now not as the pain, but as the warmth behind the rain. i lay the flowers down with care, and leave the rest still blooming there. no need for words, nor final line you live on in all i've known. and when i walk, i do not cry, but pause once, watching swallows fly."
The Love You’ll Never Know,Top-Air461,"I love you, though you’ll never see, The way you mean the world to me. I speak no words, I make no claim, Yet every thought recalls your name.  I watch you laugh, I hear you speak, I feel my silence start to leak. A thousand things I’d like to say But fear would only drive you away.  So here I stay, just out of sight, A shadow dancing with the light. You live your life, you smile, you shine, Unknowing that your joy is mine.  I wish you’d turn and see me there, Not out of need-but just to care. Yet even if you never do, I’ll still be here, just loving you.  No promises, no hope to keep, Just dreams I visit when I sleep. And though you’ll never truly know, I loved you once, and love you so.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7zH3oqkgbt  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/4kYJltqC62 ","i love you, though you'll never see, the way you mean the world to me. i speak no words, i make no claim, yet every thought recalls your name. i watch you laugh, i hear you speak, i feel my silence start to leak. a thousand things i'd like to say but fear would only drive you away. so here i stay, just out of sight, a shadow dancing with the light. you live your life, you smile, you shine, unknowing that your joy is mine. i wish you'd turn and see me there, not out of need-but just to care. yet even if you never do, i'll still be here, just loving you. no promises, no hope to keep, just dreams i visit when i sleep. and though you'll never truly know, i loved you once, and love you so."

I am the sun and he is the moon.,Interesting-One7399,"I am the sun and he is the moon. We give and take, at times he needs my light to stay grounded, other times I need his darkness to soften the harsh burn of the light that burns so intensely. It all flows out destroying everything in its path carelessly. The darkness is not perfect either, the moon has secrets. It lies as its glowing. The glow is dangerous, it blinds you as its sparkling in your eyes putting you in a trance. You see its beauty and its pain yet you love it all the same because without it what would keep you from melting? Showing the world behind the bright beautiful wall that youve created just to keep them from seeing the hot unforgiving fire just behind the mask? The moon is sneaky, it hits you when you least expect it and tries to find excuses as to why it feels the need to dim your light. You let it go because nobody ever looked at the sun the way the moon did, embracing the heat and the exhaustion, the trauma and the scars. The moon loves the sun but is the moon in love with the sun? The moon loves to look at the stars, they are more like him. Beautiful and bright, easy to look at. The sun is hard to love too bright, hot to the touch, quick tempered, something is always going on with the sun but moon is a distractor, in other words avoidant. “If we dont talk about our problems they wont be there.” They are always there for the sun never forgotten. They are evolving, changing in different directions onto different paths and yet the sun cant let go of the moon, the moon holds on slightly and tangles the sun until it cant move. The moon suffocating the life from the sun with its hold. As the suns light dims she is less herself than she has ever been before, dim, dark, cold.

The Devil Retold,Seriously_Lost_Poet,"Your worship is a crime,          I know.          Then why am I          So tempted to grow -         A garden off your silent power         Inhale the scent         Of a wilted flower.                   You scream fire         And watch your wings rust.          Your burning rage         Turns its feather to dust.          Ruthless vengeance,          Mercy for no other -         Such is the ache          Of an absent Father.                   The angels speak your tongue.         Their sins take cover     Behind your fiery color.     Let heaven      fall heavy with the knowledge -     That when existence reaches     Its very edge -     In its foretold end,      Their God won't listen     Only you could be their friend.                    Explanation: This is a piece on the casting out of Lucifer, God’s son and one of the archangels, and being named as the “Devil”. It explores the narrator’s feeling towards lucifer as a misunderstood being and how he is basically a scapegoat as he’s held responsible for all evil in the universe and how in the apocalyptic end God may abandon us just like he did lucifer.  I understand this may be a very sensitive topic so if this triggers/ hurts anyone I apologise sincerely, but please don’t hate because of difference in ideas. Please give constructive criticism on how I can improve, thoughts on your interpretation and if the message is clear thru the poem!  This is my second piece here. If you like it here’s the link to my previous work which deals with the personification of life and death with example of a human who believes failure is the end.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/klt2wvFr3A  Your feedback or upvote on both of these will be really appreciated.

Pen Sieve,zyerhod1,"**Pen Sieve**   *by Bryon Slack*  Pensive, I sit as I sieve   with my pen—   words that fall from my mind   and the tracing of old hurts.

Drown – (i want feedback),No-Strain9095," A sea of thoughts in that which we commune, like soft whispers at night, or warm kisses when blue. A sea pthat we drown in, not that we swim in. To dream in, or breathe in, with each other in view.  We feel not to talk small, or to talk words at all, but to sink in, and think in— never to wade in. The water’s made of love that we bathe in, always perfectly warm—never near scathing.  Intertwining our fingers in silent embrace, the smell of the ocean gives nothing but taste. Slow burn. Let the candle drip. My eyes drink in the tender flame of your face. Naked bodies trace the waltz. No haste. Our bare silhouettes together, alone in the depths. A ripple of water that makes not even a sound brings warmth to my heart, like red flame curling the mouth. It lances gracefully in all directions, expanding out, touching every corner of our sea. Every breath you take completely entrances me.  Cold rain drums against my back. I shiver. Standing aimlessly on this beach, I gaze out at this familiar deep river. I raise my hand, stretch out to reach. My fingertips crave the water’s comfort— one touch to ignite all its memories. My heart screams so loud I cannot ignore its hurt. I freeze—rain trails like veins down my spine. My body yearns for that beautiful blue, but the water is tainted forever by you.  I lay flat. Feel the sand on my skin. Existing mindlessly— empty space. Stars patter the landscape. Perpetual lack of emotion. Scattered thoughts. Broken. Yet I welcome that familiar notion— the only thing I’ve known.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/2FpDhu1xJW  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ifve9jvpXa","a sea of thoughts in that which we commune, like soft whispers at night, or warm kisses when blue. a sea pthat we drown in, not that we swim in. to dream in, or breathe in, with each other in view. we feel not to talk small, or to talk words at all, but to sink in, and think in never to wade in. the water's made of love that we bathe in, always perfectly warmnever near scathing. intertwining our fingers in silent embrace, the smell of the ocean gives nothing but taste. slow burn. let the candle drip. my eyes drink in the tender flame of your face. naked bodies trace the waltz. no haste. our bare silhouettes together, alone in the depths. a ripple of water that makes not even a sound brings warmth to my heart, like red flame curling the mouth. it lances gracefully in all directions, expanding out, touching every corner of our sea. every breath you take completely entrances me. cold rain drums against my back. i shiver. standing aimlessly on this beach, i gaze out at this familiar deep river. i raise my hand, stretch out to reach. my fingertips crave the water's comfort one touch to ignite all its memories. my heart screams so loud i cannot ignore its hurt. i freezerain trails like veins down my spine. my body yearns for that beautiful blue, but the water is tainted forever by you. i lay flat. feel the sand on my skin. existing mindlessly empty space. stars patter the landscape. perpetual lack of emotion. scattered thoughts. broken. yet i welcome that familiar notion the only thing i've known."

Torchbearer,Independent_Memory41,"i. The Torchbearer  They said the world was cold and cruel, so he built fire from bone and bark. Not gifted flame, nor handed rule; just bruised hands striking in the dark.   He made his torch from shattered things: old grief, a vow, a threadbare song, lit it with hope that never clings, and dragged its weight alone, headstrong.   He walked through lands where silence ruled, where voices vanished in the frost, and though the world called him a fool, he kept his path. He knew the cost.   ii. The Town of Carried Light  He reached the gates of Story's End, a town of warm and glowing hands. Where every soul, both stranger, friend, held flames passed down in ancient strands.   Their torches shone with steady grace, clean-edged and humming, calm and wise. His blazed too hot, took half the space, a wildfire wrapped in stormy skies.   They watched him with a quiet awe, not fear—but something close to grief. They'd heard of him, the boy of raw, who carved his torch from disbelief.   iii. The Dousing Trial  ""To join our fire, you must be still. Unlearn the heat that scorched your way."" He laughed. “I forged this from my will. It won’t go out to make you stay.”   But one girl spoke, her torch dimmed low, ""I burned too fast once, just like you."" And in her voice, he felt the snow of nights he nearly didn’t push through.   They faced the dousing trial then; to walk the river, torch in hand. His hissed and screamed like wounded men, but didn’t die. It learned to stand.    iv. The Forge and Flame  He didn’t change to fit their mold. They didn’t ask him to, in time. Instead, he taught the ones grown old how chaos, too, can be sublime.   He stayed a storm wrapped in a smile, a poet-warrior, scarred and true. His fire danced in feral style, but burned a path for others too.   Now when the lost come stumbling in, half-frozen, voice too numb to pray.

Pink little Egg,Independent_Memory41,"  I think about the little things. How something small: a laugh, a look, the way your hands fidgeted when nervous; burns brighter than the fireworks we swore would mark our start.   I think about the patch you kept playing with, worn soft from my skin, how it became your stress ball, your comfort. Something ordinary that somehow mattered.    I think about how you cried when I showed up. Not from sadness, but from the fragile weight of being seen and not knowing if you deserved it.    I remember your stories, about broken places and stitched up years, your friends who saved you, the mentor who understood.  I listened like the answers to loving you were buried between your pauses.   You thought you looked like a mess. I saw something blooming.   There was this night. You were spiraling. Doubting. Trying to outrun your own history. So I grabbed your hand and ran. Not away...just... to somewhere lighter. Until laughter knocked the panic out of you. Until you looked alive again.    I told you I loved you. And maybe that was the moment you left. Not with your feet, but with your fear.   Maybe love, no matter how soft I spoke it, sounded like a trap. Maybe every “I’m here” echoed like “You’re stuck.”    I didn’t know how to love you without reminding you of what you ran from. I tried to be shelter.  But maybe all you saw was another storm waiting to break.    I remember the hospital. The way humor became the only way I could talk without breaking down. I remember feeling like I had failed you already, even while holding your hand.    I thought we were solid. So I stopped checking the foundation. Thought I was giving you everything, but maybe it came in the wrong shape, wrapped in mold instead of light.    And yet...  I still see you.    Not just the good. Not just the brave. But the messy, the wrecked, the trembling.  And I love you for it. I always will.    There’s this image that won't let me go; a tree healing around a wound. People say it’s like a nail. But you weren’t a nail.    You were a pink egg with tiny angel wings, folded gently into the bark.  Not pain. Just permanence.   Even if nothing blooms here again, I’ll carry that shape forever.   The way your eyes dimmed and lit up. The way your silence said everything you couldn’t bear to say out loud.    If I ever find something that echoes you...  God help me.  Because beauty like that doesn’t come without grief.    And if these are my final words,  if this is all that remains,  I hope the world gives you peace. I hope you smile more than you flinch. I hope someone listens to your silences and doesn’t ask you to explain.    And if it takes ten more years for your voice to reach mine again, I’ll still be listening.    Because I know now.. you were worth the wait.

Everyone likes but no one adores,Top-Air461,"  They greet you kindly, speak your name, A flicker’s worth of gentle flame. You’re always welcome, never missed— A ghost they neither scorn nor kiss.

You are the pause, the space between, The steady shade, the in-between. Too soft to stir, too still to stay, They like you most when far away.  No songs are sung, no hearts are sworn, No yearning eyes, no pages worn. You’re always fine, you're never more— A welcome mat, not love nor lore.

Did you ever look at me that way?,Pixels_o,"You bent down slow, as if afraid to make it go, to startle something soft and true the room fell quiet around you.  Your eyes were caught, they didn’t stray, drawn to the baby, pale and gray with brand new skin and breath so light as if she glowed beneath the light.  And something changed within your stance, your shoulders dropped, as if by chance. Your brow unknit, your silence stirred, and that without speaking a single word  You looked at her, so small, so still, a weightless thing that bent your will. And in that gaze, so strangely free for the first time i think,  I saw you see.  You smiled. Not the smirk you wear with style, No, this smile stayed a little while. It trembled, small and shy and true, a quiet thing that slipped right through.  Your eyes grew wide, no longer blocked, like windows you forgot you’d locked. Soft, as if the world was kind, as if regret had never lined the edges of your steady hands, like wonder still obeyed commands.  There was no joke, no guard, no game, just you and something hard to name. A marvel settled on your face, slow and warm, like time gave grace.  And I, I wasn’t watching her at all. Not her tiny fists or body small.  I stared at you, just to the side, my breath caught low, nowhere to hide. Because I’d never seen you wear a look so open, unaware. And try as I might to look away, my heart refused. It chose to stay.  A question rose, both sharp and warm, a hush before an unseen storm. It caught my throat, it pulled me tight, a truth I wasn’t there to write:   Did you ever look at me that way, in some soft, unspoken yesterday? With eyes so wide and full of grace, as if I was your sacred place?  When I was small enough to hold, before your warmth grew quiet, cold, before love turned to nods and space, and jokes that time could not replace.  I tried to picture it, your face above mine, newborn and blinking, Reflecting your eyes,  But the image doesn’t come. No flicker, no frame, just a hollow space where love never came.  So I stood there, body tight and drawn, like something inside me had just been torn.  Shoulders stiff, and eyes cast low, wearing a calm I didn’t quite know.

Cries of war,Slow-Artist1786," I sit at my window.  A smile on my face.   I listened to the laughter of the children.  As they played.  Happily in the garden.   I listen to sound.  Of babies;   As they cried.   As they babble and played I watch as the new mother,   cuddles her baby.  Nurses her at her breasts.  And I can’t help but think.  This is what paradise looks like.   Then from a distance.   I hear the alarms.   I see the destruction.  Before I heard the alarms.  And my world is shattered.  I listened to the cries.  of the children that once played.   Happily in the garden.  Watch as their laugher.  Turns to tears.   And my heart,   my peaceful world is shattered.   The cries of war.  The cries of laughter.  turns to tears,   to heartaches.  As I watch  Children ripped from the arms.  Of their mother’s.   Cries of a Mother.  A father as they witness.   The death of their children.  The waters turn red.   With the blood of our children.  As we watch love ones.   Shot, martyred in front.  Our very eyes.  The devastating silence.  Rings loudly.  As we wonder if our children Are next   We can’t hide.  Just watch in silence.   As the world of a new born.  Is shattered.  The tears fall from my eyes.  The tears fill my heart.  As the sorrow seeps.   into my very soul I watch.  but it’s all I can do.  I can offer no comfort.  Just a prayer.  A prayer.  That when death.  Reaches my door.  I go peacefully.   I go quickly.    I listen as the drums.  The cries of war.  As it comes closer.   I live in fear.  In anxiety.

Regret,Plenty_Mistake_9577,"At the end of the road, what will your regret be ?     Not beleiving the dream before it turned to smoke,   Not holding the person before they let you go.

"Angelika, Lover…",Sinsecurity,"I wrote you a letter again:  Maybe to ask how your day had been, or really to show you just how blue these eyes have gotten since you stared last. When you could make me feel awake again with just a word or two. How I loved! How I wish I could just know everything now. How much less could I be before you see the line where I was? If I wrote you all that I could, would it even reach you? Could you understand how many tears made my sheets too gross to sleep in… to the point where I just have to say this… even if I put it right in front of you? You could know! I wish I could just tell you everything now. How much more of me could I give before you see what I am at the center?   I wrote you a poem again:  Not that you ever liked them —but no I don’t exaggerate— maybe there was a care but not an introspective moment —to come too late—that I had aimed for, ever stuck to your heart the way I yearned to. The only way I wanted to make you cry was out of an overwhelming beauty because any word I wrote couldn’t be as beautiful as its product… your single tear. Even when you cried over some silly show, it was somehow so pure from the soft voice I hear. The emotion… the only thing that’s real. The same as how you made me feel. Some nights I dream you back in my life. When the morning comes I remember why I tucked you away. I can turn your beauty to song, but I can’t make you love me by day.   I wrote you a song again:  Music just like our first night together. Singing the way I swore I heard an angel do when our lips first touched. Its chords are gorgeous and bittersweet with a nuanced rhythm and flow. That’s why it makes me think of you. The ending is unsteady, abrupt, and makes me tear up every time I replay that grand exit just in my mind. That is why it makes me think of us. My lyrics are supposed to be thoughtful but I guess I was too drunk to think about it again. That is why it makes me think of death.

Hounded, I followed what society told me, not that I couldn't achieve, I blame economy shifting so high everyone I know, it's misery. Figured by this time we'd all be magical, poof Houdini. If I made as much money as I do now, maybe 2015. I'd have the same amount of freedom as Forbes Listed, not hated by those beneath me. I'd treat everyone equally, we're all the same desiring okay, when's my turn to be blessed with simplicity? Property wage and wealth enough so I don't burn myself out before the age of fifty.

What Do We All See?,ToneOwn888,"All I see? Gaggles of humans laced with potential to build and/or destroy.  Often times, building’s done solo. Destruction’s executed in convoy.  All I see? Affirmations lost by people, found in places & things.  Often times, making gods of possessions possesses clipped wings.  All I see? A society of empty souls seeking fulfillment only they can own.  Often times, the masses fail to realize what they seek’s outside of their phone(s).  All I see? A full deck of Kings reduced to their Richards & their “modest” size.  Often times, those sentiments change as C-notes wave before zealous eyes.  All I see? Dens filled with lionesses mourning their lost cubs.  Often times, the cords of Camaraderie snap as awaited newborns enter bathtubs.  All I see? Me observing this behavior, knowing that I’m no better.

Homesick,jvstblueskies,"Can you guess what my current obsession is?          &nbsp;   *On finishing another year of university, leaving a lover behind, and going abroad.*  &nbsp;              I made a home of libraries and peers.    Ephemeral home, washed in July’s dusk,      Ithaca past, my Odyssey present.  Returning, homesick for this borrowed life    Your laughter softened evenings into dawn,   Your touch—*electric*, edged with Eros’ fire            Penelope in faith; Athena near,  You calmed the waves drowning promising thoughts,      Seas of anguish and despair, sent not by            Poseidon, but the dread of going “home.”   &nbsp;   I am back and already sick of “home.”     Blank walls still stare, but do not know my face         Mirrors hang, having forgotten my gaze.    This house is not my Ithaca. Crumbling,         Cramped, caged. Safest when unseen by kinsmen.     The flies feel safe whilst I am left to rot.    The gods that favoured me have left me bare.    I stand unarmed where once I played the part.     O Athena, grace me with your presence              I yearn for your voice: digital, divine.    &nbsp;   You were Calypso (not to bind or claim),   A soft escape, a shelter in the storm.    You stocked my raft with love and watched me leave,   No curses cast, no pleas to stay ashore.   With open arms, you let me depart for    A sea of forms, visas, and foreign tongues.    I will return, though duty calls me on.    For now, I dream of one year’s turning tide,     I shall walk the shore where Calypso waits.      Athena’s hand mending a homesick heart,   Penelope will smile with knowing eyes,     And Ithaca....not left, but redefined.     &nbsp;    Thank you for reading until the end!

wristband passes,Regorill,"a long read, this one was cathartic to write so appreciate you taking the time to read!  \-  \-  [wristband passes](https://imgur.com/a/8MuCDAR)  rifling through luggage,  which You always put off,  You debrief your impromptu work trip.  except it wasn’t a work trip,  not the kind of work You implied to the Person You Have Been Devoted To.  \-  You justify the lie:  in a way You were doing the work towards knowing  what You want,  what You feel,  what You can commit to  before the ultimate commitment.  You’re not sure if even You believe that.  dirty pants, phone chargers, nice shirts worn to impress, watches, shoes, and toiletries,  all accomplices in this lie,  make their way back to where they belong.  at the bottom of your bag your hand grabs something strange,  \-  a pair of day pass pool wristbands,  unused and joined together,   still unworn from your last day in philadelphia.  these wristbands serve no purpose,  they: evidence of a crime, a permanent reminder of what happened,  that for good or for bad, You are not the decent person You always thought You were,  and yet,  \-  You are flooded with memories,  with thoughts, feelings, emotions.  your flight back was purposefully scheduled late, it was the only way to see Him for longer.  You didn’t know or care how You would spend those final hours in philadelphia,  except that they were with Him.  You like the sunshine, the happy, the exciting,   He is thoughtful, He is kind, He gives You what You need.  maybe You told Him what You like,  earlier on in this years-long fling that has existed only for weeks.  or maybe you are so in tune that He knew exactly what You wanted.  \-  You remember the excitement, the apprehension, the anxiety,  walking to the uber in a bathing suit.  more time,  more fun,  more of anything by a pool with Him,  You never wanted anything this bad.  capriciously, your insecure self can’t help but remind You there will be  an end,  a good bye,  a see you later  or see you never.  together you make the plan:   He is dropping his luggage off, from your room shared in sin, back to his apartment,  You will meet Him at the rooftop pool nearby.  \-  You remember the awkwardness,  showing up at the fancy hotel.  You look like the most tourist-coded dad you have ever seen,  but You are confident and composed.  You feel like He gave You that.  a sudden wash of shame overcomes You:  the check-in is under his name - what is his last name?  conversations deep, winding, penetrating, easy, comfortable, hard, real.  conversations You never have with Your Fiance anymore.  You had discussed last names, yet it escapes You.  how could You feel what You feel and not remember his last name,  the diary of an insane person.  You text Him, He reminds You,  You check-in, You procure the wristbands.  \-  You remember the insecurity,  getting to the rooftop pool and discovering it was not empty.  surely, You thought, with clouds in the sky it would be just us,  enjoying these last moments of an illicit affair in privacy.  daybeds claimed, pool full, kids running and playing,  You find a second level to the rooftop and claim two comfortable looking loungers,  a good-enough spot to just exist with Him for longer.  \-  You remember the casual thought: the clouds look ominous.  You are from california,  your home is in california,  your life is in california,  Your Fiance is in california,  You hardly leave california.  can it be hot and humid yet about to rain?  You make a mental note to ask Him,  the Self-Assured Therapist,  Boy From The Evangelical South,  Child of Divorce,  World Traveler,  if it is possible to rain in weather like this.  \-  You remember the panic,  through hustle and bustle the hotel attendant hurries over, worry on her face.  You tell yourself it's nothing.  a thunderous boom in the sky breaks You.  “we are evacuating the pool,  there will be a downpour and lightning strikes any minute.  it is not safe to be up here.”  You are 35, You have had plans change,  bad weather, the opportunity to make the most of a bad situation.  none of that matters,  all You can think about is the clock,  and the flight,  and the goodbyes,   and the fact that He is not here.  \-  You remember the spiraling.  as You pace in the hotel lobby, You check the weather.  rain is forecasted to stop at 6:00pm - precisely the time You have to be at the airport,   surely a metaphor or maybe a punishment for what You have done.   You text Him, He calls You,  the 20 minutes it was supposed to take for Him to drop off his things will now be over an hour due to the rain.  You dive deeper into your feelings,  You let the insecurity and sadness wash over You.  is this how You always felt, his light protecting You?  keeping it at bay?  while the two of you smiled,  and joked,  and touched,  and conversed,  and got-to-know,  and fooled around,  and dined,  and drank,  and fucked,  and cuddled,  and made love,  and forged lifelong memories,  and experienced intimacy You had been so long bereft of,  a bone dry plant weeks past due for watering,  is this how You always felt?  drunk on feelings, You stumble into the worst hotel bar You have ever seen and order a double.  \-  You remember the relief,  the happiness,  the ability to breathe washing over You as He entered the bar.  He feels responsible for your time apart.  it feels like You could never blame Him for anything.  hours by the pool have devolved into 90 minutes at the worst bar in philadelphia,  not a good exchange,  yet You are with Him so it’s ok.  the vibes aren’t great.  You know He feels what You feel,  the ominous ticking of the clock toward an inevitable reality,  the unknowing feeling of whether or not you would ever see each other again.  its hard to truly be present.  \-  You remember the pain,  feeling like You are opening an artery,  deciding to tell Him exactly what You are feeling,  what You want,  what You need,  what You hope for.  except You aren’t even sure what You are feeling,  what You want,  what You need,  what You hope for.   how could you?  drunk on This Man From Philadelphia, clarity is impossible.  You planned this trip with clarity in mind:  You couldn’t know how You really felt from a one night meeting in vegas,  surely more time together would give You the clarity You craved.  *this was the lie, You know it in your bones.*  still You share, confide and hope for reciprocity.  reciprocity is given, and that is all your insecure brain wanted.  You are momentarily happy,  until the uber arrives.  \-  You remember the dread,  He was getting dropped off before You on the way to the airport.  You have so much left to say,  You know He does too.  You try, its hard.  He kisses You as He exits the uber and its over.

""we are evacuating the pool, there will be a downpour and lightning strikes any minute. it is not safe to be up here."" you are 35, you have had plans change, bad weather, the opportunity to make the most of a bad situation. none of that matters, all you can think about is the clock, and the flight, and the goodbyes, and the fact that he is not here. - you remember the spiraling. as you pace in the hotel lobby, you check the weather. rain is forecasted to stop at 600pm - precisely the time you have to be at the airport, surely a metaphor or maybe a punishment for what you have done. you text him, he calls you, the 20 minutes it was supposed to take for him to drop off his things will now be over an hour due to the rain. you dive deeper into your feelings, you let the insecurity and sadness wash over you. is this how you always felt, his light protecting you? keeping it at bay? while the two of you smiled, and joked, and touched, and conversed, and got-to-know, and fooled around, and dined, and drank, and fucked, and cuddled, and made love, and forged lifelong memories, and experienced intimacy you had been so long bereft of, a bone dry plant weeks past due for watering, is this how you always felt? drunk on feelings, you stumble into the worst hotel bar you have ever seen and order a double. - you remember the relief, the happiness, the ability to breathe washing over you as he entered the bar. he feels responsible for your time apart. it feels like you could never blame him for anything. hours by the pool have devolved into 90 minutes at the worst bar in philadelphia, not a good exchange, yet you are with him so it's ok. the vibes aren't great. you know he feels what you feel, the ominous ticking of the clock toward an inevitable reality, the unknowing feeling of whether or not you would ever see each other again. its hard to truly be present. - you remember the pain, feeling like you are opening an artery, deciding to tell him exactly what you are feeling, what you want, what you need, what you hope for. except you aren't even sure what you are feeling, what you want, what you need, what you hope for. how could you? drunk on this man from philadelphia, clarity is impossible. you planned this trip with clarity in mind you couldn't know how you really felt from a one night meeting in vegas, surely more time together would give you the clarity you craved. this was the lie, you know it in your bones. still you share, confide and hope for reciprocity. reciprocity is given, and that is all your insecure brain wanted. you are momentarily happy, until the uber arrives. - you remember the dread, he was getting dropped off before you on the way to the airport. you have so much left to say, you know he does too. you try, its hard. he kisses you as he exits the uber and its over. you have fully made the transition from happy, confident, sexy, certain tourist man to puddle of tears california boy. the uber driver shakes you from your daze ""hey are you ok back there?"" you realize you are bawling and embarrassingly pull yourself together. you are secure enough to know crying is ok, you are insecure enough to not cry in public. - violently ripped back to the present moment, wristbands in hand, you wonder - how long have you been standing here? for a second? for an hour? without checking the clock you can't be sure. the garbage can is right there, why can't you throw them away? you have bigger things to deal with than these wristbands, life-altering discussions and decisions to make do you love your fiance? are your feelings for the therapist real? are you getting married in 9 days? what are you doing with your life? suffocated, you find a hiding spot for the wristbands, a memory of what is, what was, what could be. - - 1 2"

I don't know who I am anymore,Saldafan,"Since everything collapsed, something in me ceased to exist. I don't know if it was the calm, the hope, or just the desire to follow.  I became a stranger in the skin I carry. I get stressed by the wind, I get lost in what I deny.  I screamed at the one who loves me most. And before guilt hugged me, it was the crying that lit the flame.  I saw myself smaller than my own fear, crushed by something I created. I made my parents cry for me, and I can't even say why.  I try to fill the holes with training, food and goals. But the more I try, the more I fail. But the emptiness squeezes me.  The school became noise, the voices around, a colorless echo. They tell me that I talk to myself, But I don't even remember who I am.  There are days when I find myself outside, as if it were just shell and reflection. And all I really want It’s about being whole again, even if imperfect.  I just wanted to sleep without weight, wake up without hating myself.

Unthreading,carnageandeuphoria,"Love doesn’t shatter all at once—  it unthreads itself, moment by moment,   until you’re left holding nothing but lost time.    There is nothing quite like falling out of love.   Feeling the once-butterflies   cocoon into clenched fists of dread.    The soft smiles and sketched futures   smudge into unknown plains—   blurred lines, cracked with resentment and blame.

Drown. Decided to rewrite this little love poem from a while ago.,No-Strain9095,"Drown   A sea of thoughts in that which we commune,  like soft whispers at night,  or warm kisses when blue.  A sea that we drown in,  not that we swim in.  To dream in, or breathe in,  with each other in view.    We feel not to talk small,  or to talk words at all,  but to sink in, and think in—  never to wade in.  The water’s made of love that we bathe in,  always perfectly warm—never near scathing.  Intertwining our fingers in silent embrace,  the smell of the ocean gives nothing but taste.  Slow burn. Let the candle drip.  My eyes drink in the tender flame of your face.  Naked bodies trace the waltz. No haste.  Our bare silhouettes together, alone in the depths.  A ripple of water that makes not even a sound  brings warmth to my heart,  like red flame curling the mouth.  It lances gracefully in all directions,  expanding out, touching every corner of our sea.  Every breath you take completely entrances me.    Cold rain drums against my back.  I shiver.  Standing aimlessly on this beach,  I gaze out at this familiar deep river.  I raise my hand, stretch out to reach.  My fingertips crave the water’s comfort—  one touch to ignite all its memories.  My heart screams so loud I cannot ignore its hurt.  I freeze—rain trails like veins down my spine.  My body yearns for that beautiful blue,  but the water is tainted forever by you.    I lay flat.  Feel the sand on my skin.  Existing mindlessly—  empty space.  Stars patter the landscape.  Perpetual lack of emotion.  Scattered thoughts. Broken.

"The first poem I wrote, which I never thought I'd write.",Zarandar9,"In short, It's a poem I wrote because of my current situation, as I didn't know how else to try to get over on what is going on in my life.   I gave it the title: Now that the colors are gone.  You brought the colors to my skies,    Painted joy where dullness lies.    Now I live in black and grey.    Since the day you walked away.  Still, beneath this heavy sorrow,    I leave a rose on yesterday's grave.    You will never know all that I gave,    But I was real, and I was brave.  Amidst the mess of my feelings,    I gave it my all to find a solution.   In the background you were pulling your strings,   You left my soul steeped in pollution.  You always knew my fears,    Now turned them to tears.    You were always in my spotlight,    Yet you left without a fight.    Our memories could fill a book,    Yet I walk alone on the roads we once took.  Before you, my days were quiet and still,    You gave me dreams, you gave me will.    But now the hues have slipped and bled,    And all I see is grey instead.  To be considered a humiliation,    I loved you without limits,    To have my love switch always on,    Now it punches through my spirits.  Always asking, always searching    Was I really that uninteresting?    Now that you are gone,    Is there something I could have done?    Now that you are gone,    My days feel devastatingly done.  Yet.. even after everything I chose to stay,    When society dictates, my feelings I should slay.    Together, we weren't anymore,    Yet I searched for gifts from my core.  It might be full of errors, mistakes, which I understand, but honestly, this was my first shot ever at something like this, I never was the poetic type in my life.

A Letter to Jonce,Thegpcee,"***I Cry for the Old Me.***  ***I Exalt for the Memories.***  ***I Protest for the Years.***  ***I Watch for the Chance.***  ***I See for the First Time.***  15 years ago, you passed. We were not very close. I can only remember one word conversations with you. You changed my life through your death. It always bothered me, because I don't want to blame you, but it is the truth. Your death killed my Innocence. You weren't the wick or the flame, merely the lighter itself. I remember the emergency room. I remember seeing you before you were taken off life support. You once were strong and undefeated. Now, crippled and an amputee from the damage. I did not understand how to feel. My dad walked us up to say our goodbyes. He asked if I had anything to say, through shaky breaths. I shook my head no. He looked at you. He placed his hand on your chest. My dad. My sword-duelist. My once-found seeker. My bully. My disgust. I remember Matt punching the wall. I remember Bridgette disheveled. I remember Dray silent. I remember Destiny wailing. I remember it all. I wish I didn't. I wish I remembered your laugh. Your kindness towards me. Your acknowledgement of me when other family members did not. I am not sure what putting this into words accomplishes, but I felt the need to. I hope you are flying high with Shane in the Heavens. I wish I had more time with you and with my Innocence. I wish I could go back. But I can not. And now I must awake from this dream. 15 years swept away in the blink of an eye. Even though we were not very close, I love you and I miss you, Uncle Jonce.

Chromatic Odyssey,PoetryCharm,"Within the silent gallery of time, Our colors blend in rhythm and rhyme. A flash of scarlet sparks desire, Fueling hearts set boldly on fire.  Some wear the fire of crimson bold, A heart untamed, a story told. With passion fierce and spirit bright, They paint the world in burning light.  In crimson waves, love takes its flight, A burning glow in endless night. Fierce and wild, yet soft and true, A heartbeat wrapped in ruby hue.  In tranquil shades of calming blue, Deep mysteries find a home anew. Cool reflections in a silent stream, Mirror the soul’s soft, hidden dream.  Emerald whispers speak of growth, Nature’s promise, renewal, and hope. A vibrant pulse in every leaf, Unveiling truths beyond belief.  Golden hues of radiant light, Dance with shadows, embrace the night. In every glimmer, hope is spun, A gentle warmth when day is done.  Yet some are draped in shades of grey, A mystery lost in misty sway. Not dark nor light, just in between, A puzzle vast, yet rarely seen.  Yet black and white stand worlds apart, One pure as dawn, one deep as heart. Yet bound as ink upon a page, They write our past in love and rage.  One is silence, one is sound, One is sky, the other ground. And in their clash, the truth is spun— We are both, yet we are one.  But in the end, we fade, we blend, Like rainbows arching, edge to end. No single hue can stand alone, Together mixed, our light is shown.  We wear our shades, we shift, we blend, No hue is final, none will end. For colors dance within our soul, A spectrum vast—a story whole.  Each shade we wear, each tone we share, Is a stroke in the masterpiece we bear. For every soul, in light or in gloom, Paints its story on the canvas of the room.  You can read my poems on my blog Lyric Haven. Link in the profile.

Elegy for the Impervious,highlightercup,"On rainy days of death and doom,  I cannot help but feel every worldly gloom.  It envelops me like wrinkles on flower,  And I neglect its part in life's grand shower.   &nbsp;  I often write feeling in verse with ink and heart,  In parchment, I bury it deep and far apart.  I hide my storms like all of us do,  Praying strength might still soak through.  &nbsp;  But without the thunder, the sun would not kiss  And all the love we give would be remiss.  So despair in glass and let it die with ours  And revel in the beauty of all our scars.  &nbsp;  Because when you smile and when you cry,  You are as impervious as the earth, sun and sky,  And as I stand in the rain, looking to the cloud.

"Still, I wonder",Kind-Reception9054,"I wonder if he thinks of me,  in the quiet moments—  when the world slows down, when the noise fades.  Does my name echo somewhere in his mind,  soft and fleeting  like a song he used to love  but can’t quite remember the lyrics to?   I wonder if he misses me—  not just the way I touched him,  but the way I saw him  even when he couldn’t see himself.  I wonder if it ever hit him so hard  he couldn’t breathe.  Or if I was just  another chapter he skimmed through  on his way to becoming  someone else’s story.   I wonder if I changed him.  If some part of me  still lives in the way he speaks,  in the way he dreams.  If loving me  shook something loose in him—  or if it broke something  he never planned to fix.   I wonder if he meant it  when he asked me to marry him,  even if the timing was a storm  and the place was all wrong.  Even if we were already  cracking at the edges.   Sometimes, I hope he’s moved on—  that he’s healing,  growing,  rising into who he was meant to be.  Other times,  I hope he hasn’t.  I hope some part of him  still reaches for me in the dark.

The Death of Creation,LowerPreparation399,"I look at the sky. Its face vast, its body clothed in whispered clouds. The forest around me vibrates and buzzes with life, green leaves reaching to caress the smoothness of the sky. Below, the fallen straw tickles at the foot of the tree—a constant reminder of impending doom and destiny. It’s once green pieces decaying into coppered ash. We saw their wreckage, and how quickly the world forsake them. But atlas,   The bugs creep and crawl, hidden by the mercy of the land. The birds soar above, their wings moving gracefully through the confines of the sky. The squirrels scurry by, working blindly against time, all their efforts focused on survival.  No one asks why.  All of creation fears us. We kill everything in our wake—a ruthless ruler indeed, alienated from grace. The trees are relentlessly cut down, the sky scorched with bitter resentment. Thorns rise among the straw, set to conquer with righteous vengeance.  The bugs creep and crawl, hidden by the mercy of the land. The birds soar above, their wings moving gracefully through the confines of the sky. The squirrels scurry by, working blindly against time, all their efforts focused on survival.  No one asks why.  The sun lashes out, setting fires. The ground dries up, rotting its fruits. The ocean cries out to the ruler of the land. The clouds rage in contempt. The ruler remains careless, his heart constructed of pride and grief. The world has allied against us, its troops hardened with indifference and hate.  We saw their rebellion, but our greed blinded us to extinction. We created currency and built towers upon doom. We flourished and thrived, but our indulgence slowly began to rot our minds.  Nature watched eagerly from a distance.  Our corruption was a double edged sword! Darkness has reared its head with a ghastly snarl. It’s children, blocking every exit.  We are consumed and absorbed, now motivated by different intentions.  The bugs still creep and crawl, hidden by the mercy of the land.

(TW: Guns and violence) A little poem I made about a pretty big problem we face,Entire-Jellyfish3359,"I'm no poet, but here we go-    We don't pass notes in class anymore  we pass glances at exits.  We memorize our escape routes,  like we do with math equations.  The silence between the bell rings,  far louder than any gunshot.    I'm only 13 but I still live in fear  What if today's the day?  What if ""they"" walk through that door  What if me or my friend don't make it home tonight?    This is supposed to be a place to learn,  although it does have its flaws,  but one of the biggest ones it has  is its not so helpful gun laws.    Every time I hear the intercom ring,  I'm terrified of what announcement might take place,  I freeze in my chair for the split second before a voice,  Horror on my face.    Luckily it's nothing today,  but it could be tomorrow  So I'm making this now,  so that we don't have to weep in sorrow.    We need to stand up for what's right  for what's humane,  and you don't have to listen at all if you don't want,  but please just hear what I have to say...    I heard poems can really get to people  so I'll try to fix a problem  There's people out there getting bullied so much  that they feel the need to do the unspeakable.    Only you can help to prevent it  make everyone feel welcome  But even that's not enough to help were it all comes from.    We need to rise up,  to protect children's lives,  this doesn't feel like school anymore,  just a SAW movie with whiteboards.    So yeah,  that's really all I can say,  but please,  just help us stop shootings, at least for today.

An Evening — written as I feel quite helpless about current humanitarian situations!,No_Buffalo8806,"An evening    I walked back from the gym in a storm today,   Thunder echoed as it rolled down the street towards me.  Hips tight from squatting, I picked up my pace   feet hot off the ground, heart beating faster.  Thunderstorms scare me, I don’t like the noise.    Filling the sky, lightning stretched   across the dark, black cover above me.  The trees lining the street straightened up,  Unified in protective posture.  I stepped away,   knowing that if one of them was struck  I would be too.     She was coming back from an aid station today,  sirens wailing and buildings shaking as her feet   brought her forwards, soiling every open wound.  Cheeks burning and arms bruised   from the furious fight to get to the flour and the   eggs and whatever else she could reach as her   arms pushed through the branches of her old classmates,  neighbours and friends.   Even if they were recognisable she couldn’t see them.     With every step I thought back  to my hours spent on Reddit or YouTube or Instagram.   What was the figure for death by lightning strike?  Surely there was a percentage somewhere.    Tapping away on my glowing screen, I did my research  swiping away the notifications from friends   and family and colleagues who would have to wait.   Ah, only 10% of those hit by lightning are killed.    She didn’t need an online figure  to tell her what the risk was —   She saw it every day.   To get back would be enough, to share  her portion. She knew it was unlikely,   one strike, it wasn’t like you got a yellow card   like in the football games she’d played  with her brothers, here, in the road where the   Goal posts to shoot were nets not people.     Settling down, I began to heat up my pasta.   I’d cooked so much the day before   that I decided to keep some for the next day.  Hot oil, extra virgin olive oil, swirled  around the pan in the thick tomato sauce.  Some splashed on my arm,   So I washed it off.     She was nearly home  Although, it wasn’t where her family was,  it wasn’t where she needed to get to.  They’d had to move, they’d said it wasn’t safe  Here, and that it would be targeted.  Her toes began to cramp as they curved over  the rubble and rubbish and ruin.     I stretched my legs up against the chair and decided  to open my phone.   Perhaps I’d watch a film,   or reply to those messages I’d left,  it had been a few days, or weeks.    Bored after a few minutes of scrolling,  I opened the News:  67 more civilians die   after latest   bombing in Gaza.    She  —-  I’d be super grateful for any feedback!! I’m feeling a little lost and helpless with the state of the world so looking to express my emotions in new ways. I’d love to know if my writing resonates with anyone else.

“The Night That Settled”,loceapeace,"   　  A folded margin housed someone’s lingering habits, and the metal disguised as a fork silently lost its outline. On the damp rim, a trace of a peeled-off name remained, and the gestures left unsaid were sunken in the stillness of the bowl.  　  Which hand was it that failed to strike? On the night when the underside of a blanket turned into memory, “Can we still say we were together in this sinking?” Something that never became warmth leaked through the reverse side.  　  Plates exposed to the same heat traced separate faces, while a laughter pasted to the wall floated, unpeeled. Voices laughing on the other side of the TV scratched against memory.  　  The repackaged “doing things right” repeated cold measurements of distance, and the unnamed hand’s residue kept gathering in the air. Beside the one who failed to respond, a memory with nowhere else to go had taken root.  　  It wasn’t sound. The hoarded stillness swelled with nocturnal pressure, and days that failed to ignite anger cracked the seam of “reaching.” Anger stored at the bottom of body heat clouded like fermentation.  　  Behind the wall, a lit cloth warped without a name, and the uniformity labeled as “settlement” suffocated within a shell of ritual offering. At the threshold, the space where unfulfilled air lingered was sealed off.  　  Whose face was that? The outline that floated with a “I’m okay”—which memory did it brush against? Perhaps the reason “help me” never took shape was that the contours of a torn relationship had already dissolved.  　  On the underside of a still-damp dish, the remnants of reciprocation bled through, and the wind, surviving only as an imitation of someone else’s afterimage, found no dwelling. Only the untouched lunch in the back of the fridge enclosed a silence that belonged to no one’s time.  　  In the empty room, another failed response kept returning. Unexchanged replies sealed all paths of voice, and the silence that should have passed lingered across multiple timelines.  　  That which remains unbroken may be the cruelest form of all.  　  Just being alive feels like betraying someone, somewhere.  　  If not letting go of that hand that night is called “settling,” then this stillness— how many boundaries, how many omens has its heat crossed to exist?    ----    Interpretive Poem｜“The Night That Settled”   　  “Silence” is always stored in a shape that denies harm. Beside the one who couldn’t hold a voice, there’s a disquiet in calling it “settled.”  The unspoken response, the unmoved hand, the cooled residue—  These continue to ferment within memory, until the very fact of “what was left behind” becomes the deepest wound.  In this piece, an unending night is shaped by a chain of sub-actions no one can name or accuse.  The cruelty of “remaining intact.” The way “still being alive” morphs into betrayal. And the nocturnal pressure that denies even the one who failed to respond a place to be.  This stillness isn’t prayer— it’s a mimicry of offering. Only the ember of transgressed boundaries begins to burn the true form of “settlement.”   ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 ","a folded margin housed someone's lingering habits, and the metal disguised as a fork silently lost its outline. on the damp rim, a trace of a peeled-off name remained, and the gestures left unsaid were sunken in the stillness of the bowl. which hand was it that failed to strike? on the night when the underside of a blanket turned into memory, ""can we still say we were together in this sinking?"" something that never became warmth leaked through the reverse side. plates exposed to the same heat traced separate faces, while a laughter pasted to the wall floated, unpeeled. voices laughing on the other side of the tv scratched against memory. the repackaged ""doing things right"" repeated cold measurements of distance, and the unnamed hand's residue kept gathering in the air. beside the one who failed to respond, a memory with nowhere else to go had taken root. it wasn't sound. the hoarded stillness swelled with nocturnal pressure, and days that failed to ignite anger cracked the seam of ""reaching."" anger stored at the bottom of body heat clouded like fermentation. behind the wall, a lit cloth warped without a name, and the uniformity labeled as ""settlement"" suffocated within a shell of ritual offering. at the threshold, the space where unfulfilled air lingered was sealed off. whose face was that? the outline that floated with a ""i'm okay""which memory did it brush against? perhaps the reason ""help me"" never took shape was that the contours of a torn relationship had already dissolved. on the underside of a still-damp dish, the remnants of reciprocation bled through, and the wind, surviving only as an imitation of someone else's afterimage, found no dwelling. only the untouched lunch in the back of the fridge enclosed a silence that belonged to no one's time. in the empty room, another failed response kept returning. unexchanged replies sealed all paths of voice, and the silence that should have passed lingered across multiple timelines. that which remains unbroken may be the cruelest form of all. just being alive feels like betraying someone, somewhere. if not letting go of that hand that night is called ""settling,"" then this stillness how many boundaries, how many omens has its heat crossed to exist? ---- interpretive poem""the night that settled"" ""silence"" is always stored in a shape that denies harm. beside the one who couldn't hold a voice, there's a disquiet in calling it ""settled."" the unspoken response, the unmoved hand, the cooled residue these continue to ferment within memory, until the very fact of ""what was left behind"" becomes the deepest wound. in this piece, an unending night is shaped by a chain of sub-actions no one can name or accuse. the cruelty of ""remaining intact."" the way ""still being alive"" morphs into betrayal. and the nocturnal pressure that denies even the one who failed to respond a place to be. this stillness isn't prayer it's a mimicry of offering. only the ember of transgressed boundaries begins to burn the true form of ""settlement."" ---"
At the edge of my ache,Small_Wash_7591,"Dear Kait.  I was never the truth but I will love you like one.   At the Edge of My Ache (A song for Kait)  Verse 1  I was never the light,   just the color of bruise.   A wind through your cupboard   that borrowed your shoes.   You slept like a lighthouse   that blinked just for me,   but I lived like the shoreline   that longed to be sea.    Chorus 1  I was never the truth,   but you gave me your vow.   You lay with my fever   and stayed through the howl.   You moved through my hunger   like hands through the quake,   and I opened like ground   at the edge of my ache.    Verse 2  You read me like scripture   too old to be taught.   Not line by line,   but by where it had fought.   You said you weren't shrine,   but I prayed at your wrist   like a monk with a hunger   he forgot to resist.    Chorus 2  I was never the truth,   but you kissed me awake.   You gathered my pieces   like dawn gathers lake.   You held me like rivers   hold the memory of rain,   and I learned what love means   at the edge of my ache.    Verse 3  We danced like the dying,   no music, no floor.   Your breath taught my body   what mine was for.   Not healing. Not fixing.   Just finding the place   where you shiver with someone   and call it your faith.    Verse 4  If I vanish tonight,   do not carry my name.   Let the walls hold their silence,   the kettle remain.   Let starlight be witness,   let moonrise be song.   Let the dog dream of morning   And the sun rise alone    Chorus  I was never the truth,   but I died in your place,   the one with no questions,   no glory, no grace.

“The Silence Before the Storm”,Think-Pineapple5790,"There was a time—I think—before the ache, Before the shards of love began to shake Inside this quiet chest I wear like skin. But time has blurred the place where I begin.  I try to trace it, finger-light and slow, The version of myself I used to know. The one who laughed like light was in her bones, Who spoke in stardust, danced through dusk alone.  Was there a moment, bright and undefined, When I believed in love without rewind? Before the red flags waved like silent cries, Before your name became a ghost in skies?  Now memory’s a dim-lit, crooked hall, With pictures I can’t reach along the wall— Faded frames of feelings I can’t name, A warmth, a touch, a flame that’s not the same.  Did I once smile without the bitter edge? Or lean into a kiss without a hedge Of fear, of loss, of what might not stay true? Did I feel whole before I fractured through?  You left like storms do—loud, then eerily still, And now I carry you against my will. Not in love, not in longing—not quite hate— Just in the echo where I seal my fate.  There’s grief, but not for you—no, not for you, But for the me who never really knew That hearts don’t always break with sound and scream, But in the quiet killing of a dream.  I can’t remember what I used to feel. Was love once soft? Was any of it real? Did the sun set slower when you were near, Or was that just the story I held dear?  Maybe forgetting is the final thread, The last release from all the tears I bled. But still I mourn the stranger I once was— Before I learned what heartbreak truly does.  So here I stand, in shadows I’ve outgrown, Half of me missing, half carved into stone. And if I smile, it’s only out of grace— For all the selves I lost to your embrace.

Halfway Home,EtTuBrotus,"I met a woman recently in a warm land beneath perfect skies. We barely spoke. Just a few looks, a few smiles, and a conversation in broken languages, but something about her shook me to my core. I felt a connection that frightened me, because I’m already in a loving relationship and I felt like I was on the edge of something that risked it all.   This poem is about longing. That deep, aching longing. About the *what ifs*. About the intoxicating pull of another possible life, the kind you glimpse only briefly before returning to your own. It’s about seeing that fantasy so very clearly and then somehow, slowly and painfully, making your way back home.  **Halfway Home**  I am, I think, ‘bout halfway home    I have no map or watch to mark  The lonely journey through the dark  From heady nights and starry skies,  the man I could be in your eyes,  back to washing up and laundry day  and real life and cloudy grey     I mourn the man I left behind  It’s like he died, yet still inside  He only lived inside your eyes  On heady nights under starry skies  Now again the man I’ve always been  The one just longing to be seen     I think of Frost, the other path  The one that echoes with your laugh  Of winks and smiles and playful looks  Bishop taking kingside rook  I longed, I cried, I beat my breast  And screamed your name in silence, yet    I took the other path     I know not how long left to go  Present body, mind halfway home  Sometimes I walk, sometimes I sail  Sometimes I just try to keep my head above water     She doesn’t know. At least not all  Of quite how far I had to fall  Back to her arms, routine embrace  But my mind is in another place  A place of wonder, of sweet “what if”  Of words unsaid and lips unkissed     It was real for me. Was it for you?  Would I find peace even if I knew?  A slip of paper, held like gold  With a door left open, things untold  A scribbled number, passed through a friend  And cherished right till journey’s end     I resist with love - for you and her  For a moment that would break the moment I touched it    It’s taken time, it will take more  But soon I’ll be back at the door  Of something real, something mine  Something built with care and time  And love and smiles and tears and strife  Something I’d choose in every life     But for now, I am  I think  ‘bout halfway home     [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m8hbiv/comment/n4ziyb2/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m8hbiv/comment/n4ziyb2/?context=3)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m8hdp8/comment/n4zhog9/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m8hdp8/comment/n4zhog9/?context=3)","i met a woman recently in a warm land beneath perfect skies. we barely spoke. just a few looks, a few smiles, and a conversation in broken languages, but something about her shook me to my core. i felt a connection that frightened me, because i'm already in a loving relationship and i felt like i was on the edge of something that risked it all. this poem is about longing. that deep, aching longing. about the what ifs. about the intoxicating pull of another possible life, the kind you glimpse only briefly before returning to your own. it's about seeing that fantasy so very clearly and then somehow, slowly and painfully, making your way back home. i am, i think, 'bout halfway home i have no map or watch to mark the lonely journey through the dark from heady nights and starry skies, the man i could be in your eyes, back to washing up and laundry day and real life and cloudy grey i mourn the man i left behind it's like he died, yet still inside he only lived inside your eyes on heady nights under starry skies now again the man i've always been the one just longing to be seen i think of frost, the other path the one that echoes with your laugh of winks and smiles and playful looks bishop taking kingside rook i longed, i cried, i beat my breast and screamed your name in silence, yet i took the other path i know not how long left to go present body, mind halfway home sometimes i walk, sometimes i sail sometimes i just try to keep my head above water she doesn't know. at least not all of quite how far i had to fall back to her arms, routine embrace but my mind is in another place a place of wonder, of sweet ""what if"" of words unsaid and lips unkissed it was real for me. was it for you? would i find peace even if i knew? a slip of paper, held like gold with a door left open, things untold a scribbled number, passed through a friend and cherished right till journey's end i resist with love - for you and her for a moment that would break the moment i touched it it's taken time, it will take more but soon i'll be back at the door of something real, something mine something built with care and time and love and smiles and tears and strife something i'd choose in every life but for now, i am i think 'bout halfway home"

There is beauty in its purity, and in its endurance.  Or so they say.   I know a fire that burns perpetually has the capacity to scar you for as long as it lives.

"Wrote this during a moment of reflection. I’ve been through a lot—bad choices, closed doors, and learning the hard way. This one’s for anyone who’s ever felt like they were too far gone to change. You’re not. We’re not. Hope it hits someone the way it hit me writing it.",Fit-Weakness223,"Title: Doors By Ramon L. Rico – 04/16/2025  During my life, doors have been opened, and a lot of them have been closed. People see the good in me, and I ignore them, thinking that they were a joke. Or maybe I just misunderstood, and I just closed the door on them because they wasn't my folks. They didn't talk, walk like me, or even had that look. I was naive, not realizing I had picked my road.  Believeing I had sealed my fate and always be no good, I became a soldier and started doing as I was told.  Going in and out of the halls, especially making it into the big leagues, I didn't have to try hard to show the older homies I was part of the team. But deep inside, I was distraught, and I wanted to release all this hatred in me. With no one to trust, I used it as an aspiration to turn me into a beast. The doors started closing one by one, that people didn't trust or even wanted to believe That I could change the things that I've done and be a better man, not just what they see. I'm not gonna lie, I had a lot of fun, but I also lost a lot of sleep. A lot of time behind them bars, lost to a cause that don't give a fuck about me. I started being a follower very young, instead of taking that lead.  & That was my mistake, making excuse after excuse of why I am this way. Now I fully understand that shit wasn't cute. And we all have to deal with the consequences and choices we make. But I REFUSE to let that close any doors that open today. And today I can choose where my life is headed and not worry about yesterday. I am a leader that is true.

Still here.,Saldafan,"Sometimes I feel like I'm not living, but just reliving everything. Stuck in scenes that have already passed, but that still hold me back.

And it's not because I want to, but because, honestly, I don't know how to get out anymore. The longing became a routine, the memory, perhaps, a prison…?

Penance / The Long March,bitionboyz,"I posted an earlier version of this poem before and have continued to tweak it after getting some feedback. Let me know what you think and what can be improved.

Doubt-laced tendrils   Burrow and afflict   This mind once pure and true.   A crown of pain adorns   The skull and skin, now etched with guilt.

Mouth Sounds and BL00d shed.,SirMoNothingess,"Mouth Sounds and Bl00d shed (this is written for spoken word i thinl)      It is seven pm    and I am trying to sleep,    so I plug my earbuds and lay still.    The asmr video on my screen     tells me I am on a flight.     She holds a single tortilla     says she’ll break it for everybody on board     and in that same calm voice whispers     where is Jesus when you need him?           Laughter comes first     and then my brows crease,     Where 𝘪𝘴 Jesus when you need him?           Where is Jesus     Now that children are running after water trucks     hoping a drop falls off—     to gather the congealed sand     and suck the wet grit     for their first taste of the day?           Where is Jesus     when seven year old boys are running     to spots where bombs are sure to be dropped     because that’s where food is being shared?           Brother needs this backpack to not be empty.     Even if the bomb is set for 2:30,     he’ll wait till 3- baby sister is waiting.     her stomach, drier than Khan Yunis—     nothing left to pad her ribs,     Nothing left to fool hunger even for a while.     The 12-mile walk back to her,     is too long to make     with the weight of an empty bag on his shoulder.           Because the hope     for a spoon of plain lentils     in the backpack-turned-bowl     far outweighs the fear of death.           because death     now feels like a long awaited family reunion.          Because he has watched     their playmates body parts rain down     along with concrete, metal,     whatever buildings leave behind when they are forced to meet the ground.     Along with shrapnel,     along with their mother.           He does not know     if he is waiting for food     or for bomb.     But he knows     Baby sister sits alone,     baby sister is waiting.           Baby sister says     after we die, will I hear your voice?           I turn the volume up     and the bombs get louder.     baby sister's voice echoes under my binaural beats.           Where is Jesus when you need him?     Now we need him     to turn 5 weevil infested flatbreads into 500.     To bring 18inch bodies back from the dead.     To blind the child     so they don’t have to see their mother’s unborn child outside her body,     they went searching 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 for her body.     Where is this blessed saviour when you need him?          The  ASMRtist says     we should check if there’s a priest on board,     says somebody will most likely need their last rites read.     Every 10 minutes, someone along the strip needs a priest     Where is Jesus     when parents have to hold whatever part of their child is visible under the rubble,     have to lie     and tell them they can get them out     while convincing the disembodied voice to say the shahada.          The ASMRtist says sleep tight     and I hear bear witness.     I dig my earbuds deeper in my ears     like maybe I can help them drown out the sounds of drones     and bombs     and bodies begging for death.     I squeeze into myself and I am on that ground,     lying  in that tent with baby sister.     We are waiting for brother.     We are waiting for Jesus to show up     now he is needed.

Drug.,Full_Kin-g,"Aiai, love is a drug, but not those drugs that you use to forget the world, but rather a drug capable of trapping you in the world, love makes you wake up to life, in a good way or in a bad way, it just depends on how much love you have to give and how much love you have to receive.  Love hurts, because even though it's a legal drug, it's still the worst drug in the world, you become so addicted to the point of doing things you couldn't do, but you do now for love, people often die for love, people kill for love, because it's difficult to find such an addictive love in this world and no one wants to let it go when they finally find it, that's why it's the worst drug in the world, but do you want to know the real thing? You only live once, love, cry, smile, live life as if it were your last day, because you never know what could happen, so give this drug a chance, maybe you will be the person who will make someone addicted or maybe you will be the person addicted to this drug of love.  comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/7nhz3ATvov https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/zhDyR5nw2W","aiai, love is a drug, but not those drugs that you use to forget the world, but rather a drug capable of trapping you in the world, love makes you wake up to life, in a good way or in a bad way, it just depends on how much love you have to give and how much love you have to receive. love hurts, because even though it's a legal drug, it's still the worst drug in the world, you become so addicted to the point of doing things you couldn't do, but you do now for love, people often die for love, people kill for love, because it's difficult to find such an addictive love in this world and no one wants to let it go when they finally find it, that's why it's the worst drug in the world, but do you want to know the real thing? you only live once, love, cry, smile, live life as if it were your last day, because you never know what could happen, so give this drug a chance, maybe you will be the person who will make someone addicted or maybe you will be the person addicted to this drug of love. comments"
Rivers collide,MissionYak1001," It's odd how we often go back to strangers— you and I, drifting apart like a river and its divide. I can't keep living with the thought of you still lingering in my mind.  Like a ghost trapped in its memories, you haunt me. I tell myself it will pass and just when I'm doing so well, your beautiful eyes cross my mind.  That wonderful smile, a familiar smell, a similar voice, a similar face— you are something I can't escape, like the sun’s warm embrace.  I know it's been long, but my agony has outlived what we had, like whispers that never fade.  I know you've faded past me, so I’ll linger in the past, hoping to see those precious eyes, and utter the words I've sealed inside when our rivers collide.  If our paths cross once more we'll be lovers once again. But until then, farewell old friend.

a Fling with Death,kangoook,"In the middle of the night, I laid my head to rest,   A sudden gasp of air—tightness crushing my chest.   Hand on heart, I wondered, is this the end?   Telling my saddened soul,   Is it time to just descend?   Seconds ticked by,   Reliving the joy I thought I knew—   Thirty years gone,   But nothing joyful came into view.   Instincts kicked in,   Dragged my soon-to-be corpse to the ER's glare,   Wires and cables rained down   Like winter storms without care.   The machine echoed—   Each beep syncing with my fear,   As I whispered in silence:   Would anyone even shed a tear?   Would my passing stir a ripple?   Would a single soul feel my end?   Would death even notice me—   Or am I just a life to suspend?   Then the doctor arrived,   “Good news,” he said, without alarm,   “Severe acid reflux—   Nothing to cause lasting harm.”   One small shot,   And the pain faded into air,   Leaving me confused,   Half-relieved, half laid bare.   I longed for death—   Yet death did not long for me.   I laughed aloud in bitter jest,   Oh, what a loser I must be.

Amara's Throne,Wonderful-Wealth2761,"I don't recall how we came to be— Only the vows she made to me. She came for what I couldn't be, the hush before my silent plea.  She'd burrow deep beneath my skin, and promised what I couldn't win. She swore I'd lose what I dared crave and smiled as I learned to misbehave.  She was warm before she had a name, a safe space beyond my shame. She kissed the places I denied, and whispered truths I'd never tried.

Dear T.S. Eliot- I Wrote Her the Poem You Didn’t,pettyenuf,"Dear T.S. Eliot- I Wrote Her the Poem You Didn’t     (Because you built your legacy, and left her without one)   It’s ironic, isn’t it?    That I tattooed your words   into the skin I still live inside.   I clung to your poetry   like it might be the only thing   that would keep me alive.   “I said to my soul, be still…”   is etched on me forever,   because I needed it.    I longed for the stillness you wrote about-   because the noise inside me   wasn’t something I could outrun,   or out-pray,   or outgrow.    I believed you must’ve known   what it felt like to fall apart quietly.   To carry a mind that wouldn’t behave.     But I stumbled on the truth   when I learned about her.   And how you saw her   only as a disruption-   not a wife.   Not a person at all.    You wrote of wastelands-   then left her alone to rot in one.   You said dried voices   are quiet and meaningless.   You said the world ends   with a whimper, not a bang.   Was that some kind of grand poetic warning   that you would let her world end quietly?    Did you wear those deliberate disguises   you mentioned- of a rat’s coat   and a crow’s skin-   to hide the disdain you held for her?   Was that why you washed your hands of her   in literary dust?    You turned your anguish into stanzas,   while hers stayed in hidden diaries-   where she said you must have been kidnapped.   The doctors who read her words   called it schizophrenia.   But I know all too well-   that sometimes it’s better to tell yourself   literally anything,   rather than that the man you truly loved   had left you alone by choice.    When you spoke of the hollow man-   was he you?   The one who wrote about “the still point.”   While she lived her life   helplessly still.   Devastated and motionless-   after she dried up,   along with the ink from your pen   that created your legacy.    A legacy I once believed you deserved.   Because, surely-   if someone could write   so beautifully about ruin-   they must know how to hold   a shattered thing gently.    But her broken pieces   were only held in the subtext   of poems that never made it   into your Four Quartets.    They still say you tucked her   somewhere in between the lines   of Ash Wednesday.   And that it reads like the shadow   of a man who knew what he’d done.   But even then, you made repentance poetic.   You asked to be cleansed,   but not by her hands.   And you never even called her by name.    And to this day,   I wear your words-   “I said to my soul be still,   and wait without hope,   for hope would be hope for the wrong thing.”    I thought about removing them from my skin.   They started to feel like they hated me,   because they were yours.   It felt like I had carved   the signature of someone   who would’ve left me behind,   the second my pain became inconvenient.    But I think I’ll keep it.   Because honestly-   the words still move me.   I think they always will.    But now,   when someone asks about the poem   stuck on my skin,   I’ll tell them about you.   And I’ll tell them about her too.    But unlike you,   I’ll tell them everything.   I won’t leave her vague-   not by name, and not by story.    I’ll tell them all about her-    Vivienne.    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/GijrXcuRmL  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/mRZ7pgBRXM  ","dear t.s. eliot- i wrote her the poem you didn't because you built your legacy, and left her without one it's ironic, isn't it? that i tattooed your words into the skin i still live inside. i clung to your poetry like it might be the only thing that would keep me alive.

I Wrote A Poem in the Middle of the Night,deleted,"Hey guys! This is my first post on Reddit... ever. I just wanted to share something that I just wrote in the middle of the night. I couldn't sleep, and so I jumped up because thoughts were torturing me. This is a poem about me wondering about being religious since I come from an atheist background. I fully support religion in general, and I would not like to offend anyone who reads this and feels hurt, so please refrain from reading if you feel you might get offended. I am really sorry if you do.  **sleepless nights**    on sleepless nights i think back to the darkness where i come from  and i wonder if i would be happier if i could let go  imagine myself an infinite forgiving paradise like countless others have  even though i never could.  i’ve read of people who say they were depressed before they converted  but now they are finally happy, finally free,  and i wish i could be just like them, but i know i would never forgive  myself for the lies i would be telling in my head.  death is just like sleep, they say, just as dark,  just as warm, and yet i can’t help but think at moments that i will someday  fade, disappear and be forgotten.  i know it is far away but i can feel the breath on my neck,  the pressure building as though i’m sinking underwater; fading.  i could be happy just like others if i thought that my last words wouldn’t be  my last words, my last breath not my last breath,  and as i toss and turn in my bed i keep imagining running  on beautiful hills, knowing it could last forever,  and then i think that maybe if there even was a hell i’d still be happy  because i’d live, that bad sensations forever  are not worse than no sensations forever, but then i realise i  i would never want to be that way, agony everlasting.  and how about my family? my friends?  they will also go someday, just like me, just like the rest of us.  i can think they are still there or i can acknowledge that they fade away  just like i will on a day when i least expect it.  i don’t think i could ever live in ignorance of science,  but i don’t know if i can live like this either; in limbo  between science and pondering about religion.  if god really did create this world, and me, then why did they  make it so hard to believe? why do they not leave a sign, and why  did they leave behind so much bad and so much hate, so much agony,  suffering, and a cruel world with many struggling in the dark?  if i admitted i wanted there to be a place like the one i am thinking of,  am i submitting to the cruelty, writing it off as natural, divine?  and how can i sleep knowing that i will never understand until  the very end?

Home,Suitable-Tomato-1499," I walked past a house I knew   The one that held me when I had no one else to hold onto.  The one that kept me warm when I was cold and blue.  Memories rushed in without hesitation.  Oh, my sweet house...  Do you know how much I’ve missed you?    Guess that doesn’t matter anymore,  Because now you’re a home to someone new.

"I loved you before, during and after...",Saldafan,"I thought before, I thought during and I still think.  I thought before, I thought during, and even after everything, I still think… why? Because I love too much, or because I'm a muggle? Maybe both, but it makes me who I am   I thought before... how beautiful, fun and light it would be to live with you, how good it could be to live by your side   I thought during... even though I sometimes felt pain, fear, or even insecurity, I continued to believe that this could happen and be something true   And even after everything, I still keep thinking... thinking about what we could have been, and how much we would love each other, I know that now everything that has happened is gone and there is no going back, I know that it is no longer my place, but even so, I feel longing, respect and love But… Why? Maybe because I love too much? Or because he's a muggle? To tell the truth, I think it's because of all this, but I still don't regret everything that happened, every moment by your side was unique and special, I feel that if you hadn't been part of my life, maybe I wouldn't even be here, life is full of choices, every day we have to choose about absolutely everything. And you felt, thought and decided, made your choice, and that's ok! If you think this was the best for you, or the best at that moment, I understand, life is like that. I know it's difficult for me to deal with all this, but there's nothing more to do about it. I think I did everything I could do for you, I loved you and tried to do my best, but if it wasn't enough for you, I'm sorry, I wanted you to know, that even after everything that happened, I still love you and I think that I will always love and respect you, I will always want the best for you and always wish that you can be happy! You were part of me and I feel special for that, thank you and I'm sorry for not being enough.

Jesus Wept (an ode to bedrotting),Minimum-Funny-4493,"I lie gloomy in bed Spikes of springs clawing at my back; Neither princess nor pea hold weight here.

I want to die! I'm never free!   And Still I Rise.  It's shift change and Sisyphus passes the baton: A cigarette, he lights and puts in it my mouth.

Bread and Slug,loceapeace,"  I tried to speak about death. But the first thing that came to mind wasn’t death itself— it was the shape of a crushed sweet at the register, sinking into the air of a bakery about to close.  Or maybe it wasn’t bread at all. It could’ve been a scrap of cloth left after dissection, marked with a date by someone and forgotten. Left in silence, by morning, the corridor for sound was already sealed.  　  “Who betrayed that sound you believed in, first?” The question came from the wind, but the silence, weightless, had already swelled beneath the cloth. Was that even sound? The sticky residue of “not quite over” mixed with the rustling of the bag, and the warmth pressed behind a torn-off name tag.  　  Death? It was the slug’s back—half-bitten, left behind. I don’t know the definition. But a frayed edge of time, spoiled by someone’s cough, stuffed my excuses into a drawer that would never open again.  No one asked. So I’m the only one who decided that was death. Like a fake sob, recorded without name, unclaimed— and floating.  　  What is absurdity? Maybe it was the way a torn promise stuck to the bottom of a shoe sat next to a yakisoba bun’s expiry date in the middle of the night. There was never an order to speak in. Only someone who wanted one, just for that day.  　  The morning after death was drier than expected. The news didn’t arrive. The light was paralyzed. The wind handed out fake warmth. Something leftover in a bag rubbed someone’s name beneath a desk. It wasn’t the chocolate that was left behind. It was some “thing” of mine, never called, that had certainly died in a box with no one’s temperature.   ---    “Bread and Slug｜Interpretive Poem”   　  It was probably bread. But it wasn’t the filling that was crushed. It was the air that wrapped around it. Maybe I remembered it wrong. A fragment without a name was sunken by the register, and that alone still felt touchable.  　  “When did the sound break?” The question was tucked into the bag’s rustle. It wasn’t the voice of wind. But if it remained in the ear, then perhaps it was already someone else’s question. Not a reply— a tremor mistaken for response.  　  Maybe it was a slug. Maybe the back of time soaked in damp. It wasn’t connected to any sentence, but somehow it was already there. The crushed sound was never replayed. Only the warmth of its shell lingered in a corner of the box.  　  It wasn’t that the chocolate wasn’t picked up. What slipped away wasn’t a name or a feeling. It was that “something” never called, never owned, in the gap that had no temperature. Was that death? Or had we simply failed to check?  　  What is absurdity? Maybe it’s a yakisoba bun’s expiration lined up beside a half-peeled promise on the sole of a shoe— in the middle of the night. There was no proper order. Someone only believed there had to be, and tried to line them up.  　  No one asks where it was left. Still, the rustle of the crushed bag remains near the feet— as if it never left.   ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7","i tried to speak about death. but the first thing that came to mind wasn't death itself it was the shape of a crushed sweet at the register, sinking into the air of a bakery about to close. or maybe it wasn't bread at all. it could've been a scrap of cloth left after dissection, marked with a date by someone and forgotten. left in silence, by morning, the corridor for sound was already sealed.

My Friend Ed,Responsible_Item9277," “You fat, ugly cow!” I hear inside – each bite, a blade of shame. I don’t know who the con artist is: The mirror, or my brain?  I lay in bed as Ed joins in. His whisper curls around my ear. “Let’s keep playing, darling girl.” I nod as I taste the salt of a tear.  Hi pretty girl, let’s make a deal, A bargain if you dare. Want to drop a few more pounds? It’ll only cost your hair.  Hi shrinking girl, are you happy now? Oh god – your thighs still touch! Toothpick legs are the goal. You need to skip your lunch.  Hello child, I see your ribs, Your spine could slice through skin. “Oh my Ed, are you proud?” He winks with a starving grin.  I wake up in a hospital bed. A tube shoved down my nose. Just once, can I avoid the thorns, And only get the rose?  Ed pulls me close, I nuzzle in. I savor every breath. They taste like every meal I’ve skipped, I’m cuddling my death.

The Day I Die,vazelineee,"# Will the sky cry the day I die,  Silver tears from a weary sky?   Will the earth reach out, arms wide,   And cradle me where I can hide?  Will water whisper where I lay,   Rippling soft like words I couldn’t say?   Or will I be just passing air—   A name, a face, no longer there?      Will someone pause and feel the void,   In quiet rooms we once enjoyed?   Will laughter echo down the halls,   Then hush when they recall it all?  I used to fear the ghosts at night,   Now I long for their pale light.   They seem more kind than those I’ve known,   In their silence, I feel less alone.  I’m too tired of playing parts,   Perfect daughter with a breaking heart.   Too tired of jokes with hollow sound,   Of chasing love that’s never found.  Too tired to wear this paper crown,   Of smiles forced and falling down.   Too tired of this endless fight—   Let me float into the night.  So when I go, let no one grieve,   Just let me finally... breathe.   The day I die, the storm will cease—   The day I die, I’ll be at peace.

Unspoken,JosephBensinger,"What tears the soul is not the blade,   but knowing what we chose to keep.   Regret, by softer hands conveyed,   lies buried underneath the deep.  We hoard the shards we should release,   and polish what we should forget.   Then pray for clarity or peace,   while tethered tight to old regret.  A cry is not the end of pain—   it is the mark that pain was heard.   It does not cleanse, it leaves a stain,   a message softened into word.  The ache endures because we hid   the wound too long from light and breath.   Now truth, once quiet, lifts the lid—   and love must mourn what guilt called death.  We cannot mend what will not speak,   nor heal the fault we won’t confess.   But still, the soul, though cracked and weak,   may rise beneath the weight of less.

Ashes and Flowers - At the edge of a murdered dream,SuggestionNo2556,"I remember and return to the liminal space   where the dream continues to sing:   It lingers in the yearning that    abandoned children carry in quiet rooms    and grown women still ache with in the dark.   The holy longing drenching me,   while I’ve been waiting in the window for far too long.   I still see it, hear it, seek it out,   as a punishment now, not for pleasure.  Again I stand in the gateway of the temple.    Will it collapse like so many times before?    Is the dream simply an ultimate delusion?  *Hear me speak, for a final time:*  I was the more open mirror.   The one who didn’t flinch.   The one who saw not just the dream   but the cracks beneath the surface.   And still I stayed, even after I broke.  **I saw more than you wanted me to.**   **More than I wanted to admit.**   I saw the thread, the ruin of lifetimes, *the pattern.*   It saw what it asked of me,   what it would cost me to kneel.   And still, I stayed, even after it tore me apart.  I was to stand in the cold of our winter,    wearing it like my only skin.    I survived, but the price I paid for it   was more than just blood.    It was myself and us.  You mistook worship for weakness,   and never truly looked at me    like a place where the divine might also live,    while I lit candles from my fingertips   every time your silence walked in.   You wore wounds like thrones.   Expected offerings.   Expected faith.    Expected to be seen as holy -    even as you desecrated the parts of me   that bowed too long before your absence.   You excluded me from your humanity, yet   you had the capacity for it for someone else.   I watched you give words, regret and    pieces of who I begged you to be   to another you called forever instead.   You left me in shame and ashes, with echoes.   **So, I had to blacken the mirror.**  Because it meant too much,   it hurt too much to look at a battlefield,   at ruins, to hear only silence and nothings   when there should have been everythings.  I had to turn around and unfeel,   because staying would cost even more now   than kneeling in an abandoned temple ever did.  I went to my garden and buried    what I could no longer hold.   What could never hold me back.   Sacrificed your name and the dream   and grew a field of flowers called peace.  Yet still I hear dead birds sing requiems at our grave every time I visit.    They ask:  *How does one unwant something a soul always knew as sacred?*   *How does one not abandon their own fire, when asked to return to a temple built of smoke and mirrors?*   *How does one not betray their truth, when they keep hearing their procession being held for someone else instead?*   *How does one live with the hunger, when the feast may never come?*  I cannot answer them.   I burnt too much, burnt too long,   to not stand in my own fire and truth now,   after you've burned every bridge   you could have crossed by showing   that we were not meant to be?   **This was your truth.**   The only one I couldn't accept for so long.  Things changed after I had turned to ash   and resurrected my bones from dirt.   I cannot question **your** truth anymore.   Returning to a dead dream would be   the ultimate masochistic martyrdom.  And I will not sacrifice myself for anyone anymore.   I've suffered enough for this lifetime.   The only questions I face now are:  How can I not choose the quiet path, away from you?   How can I not leave the collapsing temple and call it    an ending that I never wanted?   How can I not stop making my heart   a waiting room for someone else’s awakening?  I screamed myself hoarse for too long at the thought   of continuing this without you once more.   Because I thought the thread wouldn't lie to me this time around.   I bargained but apparently time didn't grant me a favor.  Who turned away first, whose consequences brought us here?   How can we possibly make it right at all anymore   when what remains are only ashes and flowers    that bloomed from a murdered dream?   And how can I hold it without desecrating its meaning?  Is it too late or has it been from the start?   I stand at the final crossroads,   in the recurring echo of your silence,   ready to leave us behind.   Don’t make me go.   **Just tell me, how can I stay?**  \------  ^(This is more of a work in progress.)   ^(I haven't written much at alll during the past few months. Words failed me and I needed to retreat into silence to stay sane. I tried to make sense of a lot of things lately, and this was the result of being very emotional about making one of the hardest decisions I still have to face.

is the dream simply an ultimate delusion? hear me speak, for a final time i was the more open mirror. the one who didn't flinch. the one who saw not just the dream but the cracks beneath the surface. and still i stayed, even after i broke. i saw the thread, the ruin of lifetimes, the pattern. it saw what it asked of me, what it would cost me to kneel. and still, i stayed, even after it tore me apart. i was to stand in the cold of our winter, wearing it like my only skin. i survived, but the price i paid for it was more than just blood. it was myself and us. you mistook worship for weakness, and never truly looked at me like a place where the divine might also live, while i lit candles from my fingertips every time your silence walked in. you wore wounds like thrones. expected offerings. expected faith. expected to be seen as holy - even as you desecrated the parts of me that bowed too long before your absence. you excluded me from your humanity, yet you had the capacity for it for someone else. i watched you give words, regret and pieces of who i begged you to be to another you called forever instead. you left me in shame and ashes, with echoes. because it meant too much, it hurt too much to look at a battlefield, at ruins, to hear only silence and nothings when there should have been everythings. i had to turn around and unfeel, because staying would cost even more now than kneeling in an abandoned temple ever did. i went to my garden and buried what i could no longer hold. what could never hold me back. sacrificed your name and the dream and grew a field of flowers called peace. yet still i hear dead birds sing requiems at our grave every time i visit. they ask how does one unwant something a soul always knew as sacred? how does one not abandon their own fire, when asked to return to a temple built of smoke and mirrors? how does one not betray their truth, when they keep hearing their procession being held for someone else instead? how does one live with the hunger, when the feast may never come? i cannot answer them. i burnt too much, burnt too long, to not stand in my own fire and truth now, after you've burned every bridge you could have crossed by showing that we were not meant to be? the only one i couldn't accept for so long. things changed after i had turned to ash and resurrected my bones from dirt. i cannot question truth anymore. returning to a dead dream would be the ultimate masochistic martyrdom. and i will not sacrifice myself for anyone anymore. i've suffered enough for this lifetime. the only questions i face now are how can i not choose the quiet path, away from you? how can i not leave the collapsing temple and call it an ending that i never wanted? how can i not stop making my heart a waiting room for someone else's awakening? i screamed myself hoarse for too long at the thought of continuing this without you once more. because i thought the thread wouldn't lie to me this time around. i bargained but apparently time didn't grant me a favor. who turned away first, whose consequences brought us here? how can we possibly make it right at all anymore when what remains are only ashes and flowers that bloomed from a murdered dream? and how can i hold it without desecrating its meaning? is it too late or has it been from the start? i stand at the final crossroads, in the recurring echo of your silence, ready to leave us behind. don't make me go. ------ this is more of a work in progress. i haven't written much at alll during the past few months. words failed me and i needed to retreat into silence to stay sane. i tried to make sense of a lot of things lately, and this was the result of being very emotional about making one of the hardest decisions i still have to face. it's rough, it's only for those who know the flames and their song. the blame in this is just a sword telling a truth meant to be heard, nothing more. i might delete it again, so excuse my volatile nature in advance. this needed a place in the void somewhere, if only for a little while... ------ 1 the thread between flame and silence 2 we spoke the same flame thank you to utheliminalfox for the inspiration to revisit and speak what must be faced."
Random dream I had about my ex,c0ldf33tt,"I  I entered a serenity of fireworks and glamour,  seeing myself as one.  Faces once meant  painted in tapestries of cement.

Naked from thorns in glades  A soul extinct in tatters of benevolence.  IV  A once inkling of stardust,  rode at once and saw  the stain of my broken glass.

Perhaps Another Pair of Eyes,Old-Designer-2260,"Hi everyone!    I've shared a few poems here before, but since English isn’t my first language, I’m still really curious to know how my writing comes across to native readers.

THE GREAT WAVE OF KANAGAWA,Fancy_Dot6622,"It just sits there- great talons like broadswords unsheathed.  That is- from my perspective at least.  It vastly outgrows the mere mountain on the horizon- the one rooted foolishly to it's spot and conquered and man.  But man daren't conquer this awakened and rolling crest.  But you see- this is unseen from man's perspective- or at least from that of the artist.  We merely see two masses of charred black and smoking, foaming white.  For art is not enough to grant the knowledge of who wakes and who sleeps.

"How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 4",zyerhod1,"**How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 4**   *(1966–1969)*   by Bryon Slack  We lit the match in Watts in '65   but called it theirs when the city burned.   We blamed tempers, not the tinder—   not the cops who beat Marquette Frye,   not the poverty, not the smog-thick ceilings   pressing down on families penned by red lines   we drew ourselves.   We called it a riot.   We knew it was Wrath.   And rage knows every boarded window by name.  We sent troops into Newark in '67   after cops killed John Smith   and dumped his broken body   into a precinct basement,   like they were storing evidence   to solve who'd done it.   We told the world we were restoring order—   as if order isn't something   we manufacture daily.  We shot Detroit into silence   with tanks and rifles on 12th Street,   after we'd zipped up the last bag   we called it a rebellion.   43 dead.   Hundreds injured.   Thousands arrested.   But the real number was deeper—   in homes burned,   in trust shattered,   in the echo of our own soldiers   marching through broken neighborhoods   we were never going to rebuild.  We could have fixed it with Kerner’s words:   ""This is our nation, moving toward two societies—   one black, one white—separate and unequal.""   But we shelved the report.   Defunded the programs.   Blamed the victims... again...   Because reckoning was too close to repentance,   and repentance required change.  By 1968, we were nervous.   King was still marching.   Too many of us were listening now.   Then Memphis, another strike.   Garbage workers holding signs   just to say they were human.   And the bullet found King.   And we found new ways to justify the noise.  We gave him a holiday   but not the justice he died demanding.   We clipped his quotes,   diluted his fire,   made him safe for school assemblies.   We teach peace,   but never the part   where he told us peace without justice   was just quiet oppression.   A Hallmark card of polite protest.  Then cities burned again—   not just one, but more than a hundred.   Washington. Chicago. Kansas City.   We looted them first—of opportunity,   of fairness, of air, of safety—   and then we wept   when they returned the favor   in flames and fury.  We were scared of their anger   but never our own apathy, so...   We kept pushing.  By the time the Panthers showed up armed   in Sacramento’s statehouse,   we called it terrorism—   because our fear   has always been louder than their grief.   Even when they fed kids,   even when they built clinics,   even when they tried to do   what we never would.  We had a choice.  To listen.   To rebuild.   To take responsibility   before the ledger filled with names   we’d never bother to read in full.  But we made the same choice we always do.  And when the next bullets flew,   we made sure the barrels turned inward   at a young unifier in Chicago.   Because we knew what was coming.   Because we knew   they’d finally learned to reload.  **Feedback:**   [""Inheritance""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6orm1/comment/n4ln4se/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""A Lesson in Vulnerability for a Fish""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6hcez/comment/n4lobff/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","19661969 by bryon slack we lit the match in watts in '65 but called it theirs when the city burned. we blamed tempers, not the tinder not the cops who beat marquette frye, not the poverty, not the smog-thick ceilings pressing down on families penned by red lines we drew ourselves. we called it a riot. we knew it was wrath. and rage knows every boarded window by name. we sent troops into newark in '67 after cops killed john smith and dumped his broken body into a precinct basement, like they were storing evidence to solve who'd done it. we told the world we were restoring order as if order isn't something we manufacture daily. we shot detroit into silence with tanks and rifles on 12th street, after we'd zipped up the last bag we called it a rebellion. 43 dead. hundreds injured. thousands arrested. but the real number was deeper in homes burned, in trust shattered, in the echo of our own soldiers marching through broken neighborhoods we were never going to rebuild. we could have fixed it with kerner's words ""this is our nation, moving toward two societies one black, one whiteseparate and unequal."" but we shelved the report. defunded the programs. blamed the victims... again... because reckoning was too close to repentance, and repentance required change. by 1968, we were nervous. king was still marching. too many of us were listening now. then memphis, another strike. garbage workers holding signs just to say they were human. and the bullet found king. and we found new ways to justify the noise. we gave him a holiday but not the justice he died demanding. we clipped his quotes, diluted his fire, made him safe for school assemblies. we teach peace, but never the part where he told us peace without justice was just quiet oppression. a hallmark card of polite protest. then cities burned again not just one, but more than a hundred. washington. chicago. kansas city. we looted them firstof opportunity, of fairness, of air, of safety and then we wept when they returned the favor in flames and fury. we were scared of their anger but never our own apathy, so... we kept pushing. by the time the panthers showed up armed in sacramento's statehouse, we called it terrorism because our fear has always been louder than their grief. even when they fed kids, even when they built clinics, even when they tried to do what we never would. we had a choice. to listen. to rebuild. to take responsibility before the ledger filled with names we'd never bother to read in full. but we made the same choice we always do. and when the next bullets flew, we made sure the barrels turned inward at a young unifier in chicago. because we knew what was coming. because we knew they'd finally learned to reload.

And here’s where I’ll hold you, safe in my eye,  Where you’ll feel no hate nor pain nor judgement or lie, Never to make you feel the hurt of my truth as you pass me by,  Here I’ll remain, plain for you to see, A veiled soul, wishing to be free.

Singular flux,Ok_Manufacturer_195,"I have spent so long viewing myself as nothing but trash I don’t know how to see more than the broken bits I was left with.  I hate almost every part of me, while trying to reshape what the world demanded I be. They said I was worthless, unlovable, not enough and somehow, too much all at once.  I’ve known love. I’ve lost it too. And each time it slipped away, I wondered if the world was right.  When my mind turns into a bell tolling every failure, every echo I’ve been fed “You were supposed to be special,” then later, “You’re fat, worthless, not man enough, not rich enough.”  No one stops to ask what that does to someone.  It made me small. Smaller than my six-foot-one frame, smaller than the space I take up just a few inches of soul curled inside a dark corner, trying not to be a burden.  The burn-out. The fuck-up. The waste of space.  But I try.  Maybe that’s why bonds break, why people drift, why I still fear I’ll never have a family to hold, a love that stays. Maybe I’m built to live in singular flux spinning in place, just out of reach of something whole.  But I’m still here. And I still try.

Looking for feedback on coursework,taflad,"Hi all,  I'm looking to get some feedback on some poems I recently submitted for a course I am taking and the returned commentary on the submission. I'm asking as I genuinely thought that these poems we're to the best of my ability. Is the commentor correct? Do they not illicit any appeal to any senses? I'm not looking for validation on the work, just to see if the commentary is fair       If this is not allowed here, my apologies.  Poem 1:  **The life worth lived**     Growing older, no escape  My younger self, losing shape  Losing hair, and that’s the truth  My youth now just a dreamscape     Once, I was a young man, true  Experience to accrue  Never doing as I should  Manhood, yet to make debut     A dad at just seventeen  The future yet still unseen  Just a boy, feeling moonstruck  I was stuck somewhere between     Then In a blur, came girl two  And a marriage, that came too!  Children, to which I’m curator  Family to cater to     4 years on, another child  Life’s rollercoaster gone wild  Life flew by, I felt, forsooth  Feeling like youth’s exiled     Three more orbits ‘round the sun  Another child, this, a son  Family complete, I sigh  He’s to be our final one     Forty now, no ambition  Lost passion and cognition  Nostalgia, a heavy load  On the road to perdition     But it hasn’t all been bad  Theres been more happy than sad  Through life, we’ve wanted for nigh  For my family, I’m glad     We’ve built home and family,  We’re together, come what be  Our lives now not on standby  The future, I can’t wait to see  Poem 2:  **Cogs**     Work hard! Work Hard!  Punch clock or card  Never be bard  Live through the grind     Knees gone? Bad back?  Work or get sacked  Stay on their track  And from their mind     Middle aged yet?  tougher it gets  that is no threat  our world defined     sixty-five now  got here, some how  still a cash cow  life left behind     time for the grave  try to be brave  whole life, enslaved  you won’t be pined  Poem 3:  **Her ballad**     On a mountain, all alone  Far above the city drone  Through the trees, the wind did moan  He stayed and waited for her     Long ago and far away  In a place he could not stay  Both turned into love’s cliché  He said that he’d wait for her     No word from her for many years  And love turned into bitter tears  His biggest hopes turned into fears  And still he waited for her     Seventeen long years went by  Everyday he’d wait and sigh  “Why, oh Why, did my love lie?”  I shouldn’t have waited for her     As the cold wind chilled his core  And with the pain that he had bore  He longed to feel the hurt no more  No longer he’d wait for her     From the mountain he did leap  As if a man in a deep sleep  Now in a grave, 6 feet deep  He wished she’d waited for him  The commentary I had to write  My first poem tried to be an example of a Welsh poetry form called Englyn Cyrch. This form is defined by using 4 lines, 7 syllables per line. There is a rhyming scheme where lines 1,2 and 4 rhyme and then line 3 rhymes with a syllable of a word somewhere in the middle of the last line. This was a great challenge that I very much enjoyed. I used my personal life to create this poem. The tight structure really meant that I had to be careful with what I say without compromising the theme. I spent about 4 days rewriting this, trying different rhyming words and trying to fit them into the strict syllable limit.     My 2^(nd) poem is another Welsh form poem called Rhupunt. This form relies on rules that say:  * Each line or stanza contains 3 to 5 sections * Each section has 4 syllables * All but the final section rhyme with each other * The final section of each line or stanza rhymes with the final section of the other lines or stanzas     This was also a very fun challenge. It again relied on a very strict format, and this one took around 3 days for me to fully complete. Although still a personal view, I wanted this to appeal to the readers sense of work in the modern world. I found it a little easier to write because I didn’t have to make it so personal. Again, I enjoyed the tight restrictions of the form, and I have learned that I can make some poetry with such tight restrictions. This has opened up a whole field of poetry that I wasn’t aware of     For my final poem, I wanted to initially write a fun limerick, but after learning about the limits put on them, I decided to write in a more free form style. I’ve tried to keep the sing-song quality of a limerick, but the theme isn’t a fun one. As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to originally write a story for this, so I decided to write out a plot line that I had been playing with and turn it into a poem. This poem was all fiction and I was able to still tell a fictional story whilst keeping with my choice of poetry for this EMA. I had a lot of fun writing the outline for this, using words that fit the narrative but also maintained the limerick-like flow.  The feedback received (this is verbatim, spelleing mistakes are genuine)  || || |Comments on your creative writing| |The poems in this EMA do not very effectively draw on the rich possibilities of language and any appeal to the five senses of the reader remains at a somewhat undeveloped level. There is a fairly unusual rhynng scheme in the first poem and this adds a little brio but the arguments tend to be couched in very abstract language. 'Cogs' is a stronger and terser poem but 'Her ballad' suffers from poeticising inversion as well as ungrammatical language (ie 'the pain that he had bore' - this should read 'borne'). |  || || |Comments on your commentary| |The commentary is wrongly set in single spacing though prose for this module is supposed to be set in double spacing.

Death: an old friend,Raee_lovelorn_poet,"Everything I reached for left echoes in my ribcage, hollow songs in place of heartbeats. I bled into the cup of hope like a sinner still believing that wine could be made from pain. every gulp a lie I told myself: ""Maybe this time, it’ll be enough.""  Shaky hands, knelt at the altar of what-ifs— the gods long gone, The cold tiles beneath my knees know me better than anyone ever did, and my prayers heavy like rusted chains around my throat, half breathless from the silence that swallowed every word.  I begged for death— not the kind that comes quiet in sleep, but one that walks in wearing the face of someone who once stayed. A familiar hand cupping my cheek as if to say, ""You’ve mourned enough. Come home, love. Come home.""  Maybe then, I'd finally get to hold someone without apologizing for the weight I bring. Maybe then, the cracks in me wouldn’t be punished for leaking too much love.  I’m tired. My soul is tired. Of stitching smiles for others while letting myself bleed beneath.  Love and I never truly met— We were always just two strangers walking opposite streets. I waved. It never looked back.  So if I go— let it be into arms that know what it means to stay. Let death be the first to truly hold me.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/8t3EraK2N6 https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NWHZWffYOp","everything i reached for left echoes in my ribcage, hollow songs in place of heartbeats. i bled into the cup of hope like a sinner still believing that wine could be made from pain. every gulp a lie i told myself ""maybe this time, it'll be enough."" shaky hands, knelt at the altar of what-ifs the gods long gone, the cold tiles beneath my knees know me better than anyone ever did, and my prayers heavy like rusted chains around my throat, half breathless from the silence that swallowed every word. i begged for death not the kind that comes quiet in sleep, but one that walks in wearing the face of someone who once stayed. a familiar hand cupping my cheek as if to say, ""you've mourned enough. come home, love. come home."" maybe then, i'd finally get to hold someone without apologizing for the weight i bring. maybe then, the cracks in me wouldn't be punished for leaking too much love. i'm tired. my soul is tired. of stitching smiles for others while letting myself bleed beneath. love and i never truly met we were always just two strangers walking opposite streets. i waved. it never looked back. so if i go let it be into arms that know what it means to stay. let death be the first to truly hold me."
Ache,ew_ell,"Hi, this is my first poem being shared on this forum or in general. You can rip me apart in the comments as you wish. This to me is about the feeling of waking up from a dream of someone who used to tear your insides apart, forward and backwards. But still feeling their soft touch before you wake up. Someone you know deeply but will forever onward be strangers to.   Confession—it’s comfort, like memory.   I’ll trace your heat with tender hands, wiping sweat off my brow.   Incandescent, but detached, insistent on distance.   It’s futile memory, inconsistent; romanticizing murmurs of returned desire. Seeing stars that could never catch you, only tighten their grip, suffocating devotion.   Memories erode and fall at your feet: flaking skin, bleeding raw love.   Sharpening claws between teeth.   Still, scratching so softly.   Memory is confession, when you finally wake up.

Storybook,PringlesCat2,"(A bit of inspiration from ""Sonic and the Black Knight.)  Life is a mysterious tale   Full of twists and turns and plot holes that make no sense.   I was content… for a while, but then I asked myself:  *“Where’s the magic?”*   *“Where’s the finesse?”*   *“Where’s the compelling heroes and villains that make this story worth reading?”*  So I sat and waited…   And waited…   And waited…   Till my hands decided they couldn’t wait any longer.  With a swift flash of my pen, I began writing.   The maelstrom of madness   Whirling around in my head could finally be put to paper.  A hero, charming and courageous. A shining beacon of hope to all.   A villain, cunning and dastardly, with world domination in his sights.   The plot was profound, the action was amazing   The fighting was ferocious, the characters were colorful.   It was my magnum opus.  I gazed upon my completed art in awe; my eyes welled up with tears.   It was as if God himself had written a biblical masterpiece   A world between worlds that mere mortals could barely comprehend.   Every time I’d take a stroll through the landscape   My happy ending would always come true.  Yet, even in heaven, a sense of dread and despair   Had hidden where I couldn’t find them.   I thought I had cast out any possible monsters from my sanctuary   That demons wouldn’t slip through the gates and burn down my will.   I was looking down at a hell fast approaching.  I made copies as quickly as reality would allow.   Everyone, absolutely **EVERYONE** had to see this.   Online and in-person, I managed to spread my wings   Before waiting with giddy anticipation.  It was awful.   Truly, utterly, horrific.   The people were speaking, but they spoke with venom-laced tongues   Mixed with arctic hearts of tungsten.  *“Lazy.”*   *“Uninspired.”*   *“Ridiculous.”*   *“Boring.”*   *“Amateur.”*  They pointed to cracks I couldn’t see   Played tapes of silence I couldn’t hear   Repeated my work in incomprehensible incantations I wouldn’t dare utter.  It was impossible.   Improbable.   Illogical.   There were no flaws, just blessings in disguise   That no one bothered to look into.  I screened every word   Scanned every event   Scoured each nook and cranny of plains and castles   To find anything, *anything* that was *“wrong.”*   I came up empty.  Empty threats, empty jeers, empty inside.   Is this how my story ends?  No. Not even close.  I’ve poured **blood**   I’ve poured **sweat**   I’ve poured **tears**   I’ve poured **years**   I’ve **screamed**, and I’ve **cried**   I’ve **toiled**, and I’ve **tried**   I’ve **chained**, and I’ve **choked**   I’ve **downed**, and I’ve **smoked**   I’ve hit **start**, I’ve hit **stop**   I have **worked** till I **dropped**   I’ve poured **life**, I’ve poured **death**   And I’ll be **DAMNED** if I’m at the end with nothing left.  Some may say that a good story knows when to end   That a life isn’t good if it goes on forever.   To that, I shake my head and chuckle.   Even though a deus ex machina came in and almost ruined it all   My happy little ending will be far, far away…  Far away…   Out of sight…   Out of mind…   Now that’s a story worth reading.

30 years and you're not with me,agus_getz,"30 years and you're not with me    and I pour one beer and another    and people pass by without knowing it's your day  .......  I pour another beer and skim off the foam    and refill the plates with peanuts, and I switch the tap to another keg    and I pump carefully so it doesn't get ruined     ......    You turn 30 and I'm alone,    behind a counter, in a bar with a bunch of strangers    friendly people, looking for distraction, strolling    like cats climbing the wall at dusk. And that's fine.    .......    You could have come here to celebrate    but no, of course, it would have been awkward    I could have served you your favorite style,    golden wheat or ginger beer    I could have served you an extra portion of peanuts,    and laughed with you among all these people, behind this bar    but no, of course, it would have been awkward    I could have ordered a brownie in the kitchen with a candle,    and sing you a birthday song   and make you blush,    but no, of course.    .........    Better, like this, me pouring a beer and another    behind the bar, refilling plates with peanuts    among the people stretching and moving politely    like a cat after a bath.    ..............    You'll be with your friends, of course, with some couples    chatting, today is your day, no wonder.    I could have called you, of course, but it would have been awkward.    ..........    Better, like this, me pouring a beer and another,    remembering good times we had    like when our cat scratched at the door    to get into the room    and you got up to let her in, and the three of us slept,    tightly tucked in under the blankets    on those cold nights when the cold came in    in the form of water droplets through the window     or when I lay in bed    watching you work on the computer    and the giant screen seemed to absorb you    and the colors of the screen reflected    on your cheeks with violet and red tones,    and it looked like you were blushing.    ........

Counted Voices of Blame,loceapeace,"  　  Around the memory that was never called, only the blinking light stroked a frayed presence. The folded gesture stuck as it was, unnamed, handed off just before sound to another back.  　  A certain warmth was left out to dry. Not because it couldn’t reach— but because the silence was bound to prevent touch, rolling as it peeled murky skin. In a room that allowed only one shape, a rubbed-in touch blurred the edges of vision.  　  That night, a seat collapsed. Inside a lie called “record,” only the vacant heat, sealed with blurred reverberations, remained. What slipped across my mouth wasn’t a voice, but a series of murmurs tracing the path of my utterance.  　  A kindness without shelter was mixed into the fabric of neglect. The outline of a tongue, wrapped in cling film’s tacky chill. No name was given to the heat of the tear, only a question left misaligned from the reading: “Whose voice did you bite into?” Traces of guilt stuck to someone’s collar, and a laugh, still frayed, sank into the margin stitched shut with bone.  　  Peeling rejections settled into backs. The residue of uniforms tore at the shoulder. Those who lined up the broken responses tossed them all away— throat and all. —Who swallowed that silence first?  　  It hadn’t ended. It had merely been folded, masquerading as kindness, and shelved in someone else’s closet.  　  Between fleeing and never returning, only a shed agreement, still wet, kept bouncing sound back from behind the wall. The next morning, breath alone was granted, and unnamed counted voices continued behind the wall.   ---    Counted Voices of Blame｜Interpretive Response Poem  　  Voices weren’t born to count. They were assigned to decide who gets to stay silent.  　  Around the peeled tongue, kindness refused to be sorted.

Or maybe i dont know what love is truly like,   Cause why is it that all great love stories ends with someone dying?   Is it that love bleeds from the same dull knife?  Is love even real or some illusion of our mind ?   I wish I could tell you but I truly don't know,   I only know how to dream of love that have a soul soothing flow.    I want love that feels like a landscape of fireflies ,  Someone who gives me space and a reason to smile.   A person whose world doesn't revolve around me,   The one who sees poetry in worn down sheds and tragedy.    A love so kind that I wear it like honour,   The feeling of home in a person , not some corner.   Will this love find me or stay in this word play?   Will I just float or reach my shore someday?

Devour Me Softly,KonradCurzeIsMyDaddy,"Wrote this randomly earlier, first thing I posted on this sub. (ADDING THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A HEALTHY VIEW ON LOVE) -  Love is the slow kind of hunger.

If anything,  I inch closer.  Invite you in.  Offer you the parts  I should protect.   This isn't romance.  It's a ritual.  The quiet agreement  that we will ruin each other beautifully,  with teeth,  with longing,  with the terrible need  to be known so fully  it borders on consumption.

The flower that died with the poem,Due-Presentation3959,"The Flower That Died With the Poem  Narrator: A dried flower pressed inside a love letter.  I once bloomed in the hush of a vow, Clipped from springtime’s trembling brow. Not to thrive, but to be kept Between two lines where silence slept.  No soil to root, no sky to crave, I lived as beauty mourns the brave. A crimson prayer on parchment sewn, A wilted witness, pressed and alone.  They placed me there with trembling grace, Inside a verse a sacred place. Not for color, not for scent, But for the love the letter meant.  And oh, that ink it sang her name, It bled like dusk, it burned like flame. The poet’s hand, the lover’s sin, Etched every ache I carry within.  I’ve heard the ache in every word, The softest sorrow ever heard. Where longing curled in curling script, And time, unmoved, just watched it slip.  They say I’m lovely, a keepsake thing, But I am rot with a borrowed wing. A relic locked in lines unread, A myth of love that long since fled.  I heard the drawer creak once at dawn, The book was opened, eyes were drawn But not to me. They turned the page, Unmoved by all my quiet rage.  The ink had faded, but I remained, Like whispered guilt, unnamed, unclaimed. And still I lie in twilight's fold, A broken bloom with a heart of gold.  Love is not light it is pressed and still, A hymn half-sung, a willful will. It does not dance, it does not burn It waits in silence, waits to return.  I am not death, nor am I dream, I am the pause between the seams Where touch once lingered, then withdrew, And left behind a crimson clue.  I do not bloom, I do not break, I hold what even gods forsake The memory of a love confessed, And folded back into the rest.  I envy ashes, swift and sure, Their pain is brief, their death is pure. But I decay in threads of grace, Forgotten in a lover’s place.  I smell of longing, I taste of dust, A pressed-down promise, a breathless trust. She loved him once that much I know, I felt it in the way I froze.  And now the poem sleeps, unread, The paper curled, the meaning fled. But I still here beneath the prose A godless flower no one chose.  So should you find me, soft and frail, Let not my silence seem so pale. For I have known what love once said, When all it touched was almost dead.  ""Even beauty, when caged, forgets how to breathe.""

Your Storm Killed the Me That Was,zyerhod1,"**Your Storm Killed the Me That Was**   *by Bryon Slack*  My love for you died   a death of a thousand cuts   in the darkness between   a thousand lights of gas   and the motion   of a thousand shifts in blame.  It died not fast, but slow,   in ways foretold I now know—   you rewrote my reality   and wrapped it in a cheap plastic bow.  What began as romance   curdled into recognition:   that every word,   every reaction,   would be twisted,   used against me   without even being Mirandized.  Recognition begat revilement,   and in quiet revulsion,   my heart began to sing   its song of resistance,   retaliation, and reckoning.  I didn’t know why,   at the time,   that every conversation   with you made me feel   like a cage door had just   slammed shut and a bell had rung.  But I knew, by the end,   I was always struggling to breathe,   to remember myself,   to trust my own perception.  Seven years I let you win—   you set the terms   of my relationship with my own children.  Seven years I gathered   the scattered pieces of me   from where I’d been scorched   to the bedrock by your lies,   burned down by every   flying monkey sent my way,   every old friend who believed   your deceit over decades of   knowing me,   every projection of your every flaw.  But I picked them up,   piece by piece,   learning each brick by name   and placing it with purpose   in my new House of Self—   unshakeable   by the would-be slitherings   of future snakes.  You destroyed me—   cast the flaming tatters   of what I was   into an exultant sky.  But what remains now   is only what Truth left:   raw and real,   a purer self—   a distillation,   an unshakeable new foundation   that will never again   ignore pennants   planted in crimson cloth.  **Feedback:**   [""Ancient Sun""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m6cly7/comment/n4ipg62/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""Trenches""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m66c6r/comment/n4iqh8q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","by bryon slack my love for you died a death of a thousand cuts in the darkness between a thousand lights of gas and the motion of a thousand shifts in blame. it died not fast, but slow, in ways foretold i now know you rewrote my reality and wrapped it in a cheap plastic bow. what began as romance curdled into recognition that every word, every reaction, would be twisted, used against me without even being mirandized. recognition begat revilement, and in quiet revulsion, my heart began to sing its song of resistance, retaliation, and reckoning. i didn't know why, at the time, that every conversation with you made me feel like a cage door had just slammed shut and a bell had rung. but i knew, by the end, i was always struggling to breathe, to remember myself, to trust my own perception. seven years i let you win you set the terms of my relationship with my own children. seven years i gathered the scattered pieces of me from where i'd been scorched to the bedrock by your lies, burned down by every flying monkey sent my way, every old friend who believed your deceit over decades of knowing me, every projection of your every flaw. but i picked them up, piece by piece, learning each brick by name and placing it with purpose in my new house of self unshakeable by the would-be slitherings of future snakes. you destroyed me cast the flaming tatters of what i was into an exultant sky. but what remains now is only what truth left raw and real, a purer self a distillation, an unshakeable new foundation that will never again ignore pennants planted in crimson cloth.

The Weight Of Water,PoetryCharm,"He wakes with salt caught in his throat On the seabed near a broken boat. Amidst the dark, he barely sees— His face is streaked with silent pleas.  He tries to move, but all in vain, His limbs held fast by chains of pain. He thrashes hard to free his frame, Still clutching guilt he cannot name.  He pleads, he cries, he shouts and yelps, Hoping someone, somewhere helps. But he’s too deep beneath the sun, Where light can’t reach—not even one.  His mind unravels, he's a mess, Still tangled in unspoken stress. Ensnared again by shadows' chain, Though every breath resists the pain.  The fear returns—it always stays. But this time, he will face the maze. His eyes ignite with fierce, pure light— A will to live, a need to fight.  He looks up as a hand breaks through The murky veil, steady and true. The chains dissolve into the sea, And for the first time—he feels free.  The hand pulls with a silent vow, Lifting him from the darkness now. No sound is made, no words are shown, But even the drowning can rise alone.  He kicks, he climbs, and gasps for air— The ocean fades, the weight still there. But now he knows he’s not unknown— That even the lost can find their own.  I would love to hear what you think about this poem based on the emotional heaviness we all carry.

The Darkest shade of red,Ellie_Williams897,"The darkest shade of red is not from roses, nor from wine's reluctant pour. It bleeds from wounds that never close, from love that left a hollow core.  At 6 A.M., the fire sighs, half-alive in the old brick hearth. Your photo curls beneath the light, a ghost still glowing from its birth.  I should save it. I should care. But I don't. Or maybe I do. I want to see the flames consume what once was me what once was you.  I loved you hard enough to crack, to split my soul along the seam. But pride spoke louder than the truth, and love dissolved into a dream.  Now half of me is granite still, the other half still wet with grief. Time, the liar, keeps me waiting, stretching pain without relief.  They said, “You’ll heal,” but healing lies in letting go I never did. Regret still whispers through the years, a shadow I can’t keep hid.  The fire plays upon your face, your eyes, still watching as I burn. Flowers bloom from fractured stone, but never ask for love’s return.  I reach but ash is all that’s left, a piece of you, a piece of me. You took it when you turned away, or maybe when I set you free.  The darkest shade of red is not just blood  it’s words unsaid, the love we missed. It stains the spaces where we stood, and colors every “what if” kiss.

She finds him foraging the ashen street –   A rib-cage donkey, staggering on his feet.   ""Himari!"" Laughter, bright as shrapnel’s glare,   Claims the gaunt shadow tethered to despair.    Yamma’s voice rasps, thin as dust: “The cost –   Our own plates scrape the void. This one's cause is lost.”   But Yasmin’s palm, outstretched, holds half her share:   Warm milk, a crust, thin air made tangible there.   Daddy nods – a world held in that brief incline.   The mule’s soft muzzle brushes hers like mine.    Scarcity bites deeper. Days stretch, thin and stark.   Daddy hunts the shoreline, blind in the dark,   Returns with mussels, strange and slick and grey,   Or empty hands to greet the hollow day.   Yasmin divides the nothing on her plate,   Her portion shrinks, a disappearing weight.   Her Himari stumbles now, a broken chair,   His great head drooping in the rubble-air.    Salt water trickles where her milk once flowed,   A meagre offering on a road erased.   She scours gutters, desperate, fiercely brave,   For one green shoot, one crust the bombs had saved.   She sees young Ahmad down the broken track,   His mules led off – “They’re good beasts,"" he cries,   ""Please treat them kindly. They're not Palestinians.”   She pictures them in fields, alive, sincere,   Grazing deep grass beneath a kinder sun,   While her Himari shivers, dying. Finally done.    Her sleep builds cities tall with steaming bread,   Collapsed schools weep flour where the hungry tread.   Her smile grows rare, a flicker drowned in grey.   Cheek hollows cradle dusk. Bones start to say   What flesh conceals no more. A spark ignites   Too quick – a snapped twig in the fading lights.    Then Daddy is carried home slow from West Rafah line,   No promised flour sack, but a dark, slow-trickling sign   Above his temple. “Daddy,” soft and low,   “Feast tonight with martyred kins. Eat well for Yamma and me.”   They scrape him the earth, a shallow, grieving bed.   Yasmin leans heavy on the weight unsaid.    Exhaustion crawls inside her marrow, deep.   To sit is labour. Thought begins to sleep.   Legs swell like dough left sour in the gloom,   Her belly taut, a small, denying tomb.   Nausea claws, yet “Food!” the wasted cry.   The cold gnaws deeper as the days bleed by.    She sees him sometimes – Daddy at the door,   A sack swung proud upon the vanished floor.   Her Himari nudges, strong beside her knee.   Yamma sits praying, silent as a tree,   Tears dust-dry tracks on cheeks already thin,   A vigil held against the raging din.    Then stillness. Sudden, like a snatched-held breath.   The grinding ache surrenders, welcomes death   Not as a foe, but respite. Frostbite air Wraps gentle. “Yamma…” Fragile, beyond care,   “...I don’t need food. I'm just cold. We’ll be alright.”   A phantom smile, a momentary light,   Then eyelids shut like shutters on the pain,   A fragile vessel launched on a quiet main.    Her mother bends. A kiss on sunken clay,   Whispers brush the stillness of the day:   “My bird, fly swift. Seek Papa, wait awhile…   Yamma unpacks her heart. It’s just a mile.”     ###########################    This is my 4th poem. If you like this, please take the time to read my other three poems.

Mirrors in Zinnias,BluJay42,"I entered the garden  With many plants to behold  And yet the zinnias held my attention  With many buds to yet unfold .  Their bright yellow hue  Shimmered bright in the sun  With many dots of dew  The beauty seemed second to none .  As I gazed I saw myself  In reflections the water held  And as I tended to the plants  Many of the buds, others felled .  I saw myself grasping at a bloom  And as I did I changed and grew  As drops pooled into my hands,  My image grew bigger, and the flower stood, steadfast .  Petals of copper and gold  Sliced my fingers, and stories untold  Stained the liquid a view of red  The life around me wilted, dead .  I ran from the garden as rain poured  Unsure of what the forest had in store  With unfamiliar paths to tread  I clung to the piercing petals with dread .  With fear in my heart that the flower was no more  I fell to my knees and let myself roar  As rain turned to snow, I gazed at the ice  Saw myself In the reflection and saw the price .  Having grasped too hard at the flower still whole  The beauty I saw seemed merely dull .  The blossom, set aside, drifted in the stream,  And I yearned to follow, but knew it yet a dream,  So I grasped the shard of glass  Gripping tight and steadfast .  Sharp edges cut yet again  As I held tight to what had been  But as I looked through I saw  Other flowers in the rivers maw .  Bright colors dotted the horizon  My reflection showed potential for wizen-  -ing up to what growth needs  And how to let blooms grow amongst the trees .  So with that view in hand  I took one step in loamy sand  With shifting ground underfoot  I took my rose glasses off, another step I took.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lt4ql2/comment/n4gv65d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lgqdsa/comment/n4guum1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button .

Father helpless.,Playful_Palpitation2,"For those who struggle with a family member who suffers with mental health. This is my story as a father who has watched the downward spiral bloom into devastation.    Father helpless.  She falls.  Her world cloaked in purple cloud, dulled edges, sought silence.   He searches her eyes, recalling lost days, gentle glowing reliance.   A breath held back to secret corners, tides pull to free her giants.  She wavers, eyes to his, the beginning gust of defiance.  He hopes.  She falls again.  Her skin a map of crimson grief, rain streaked, roiling stark.   Scars echoing sorrow’s stinging lashes, stolen in the dark.   He binds her wounds, callused hands trembling, soft words and quivered hug.   She turns from harbor, with bitten lip, deceives with sullen shrug.   He pleads.  She falls farther.  Her thoughts a ledge splintering, tossed and turned, despite God’s grace.  Romances yet fears the silence, of an icy void’s warm embrace.  He begs, voice a candle against the gale, truths abandoned among the shoals.  She mocks, a searing scoff,  fist daring churning skies of coal.  He aches.  She falls deeper.  Mind and soul now twisted, chasing the eye of chaliced shame.  Her heart a labyrinth of dangerous desire, contorted and betraying.   He braves the tempest of her soul, desperate to catch her fleeting.   All once was is soon forsaken, wind whipped and sorely beaten.   He frays.  She falls away.  Her will is lost among black currents, crashing guilt and lightening seething.   Arms stretched out, his heart is pleading. Determined yet broken, bleeding.

Beyond A Shadow of A Doubt,AvaneBurk,"I am the warm water bottle on the nightstand. Forgotten until desperate measures. I want to be beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I have a chance, a reason to continue beyond uncertainty. That someone will love this gnarled face, heavy like an old school body chevy figure. That I am not disposable, that I cannot be replaced by the next sad thing. Nobody asks how I am doing, and I like the facade of armor for as long as it fits. But as my feelings grow, I expand and pop rivets on a mannequin stand and I finally admit defeat like I have fallen in love with my abuser again.  I think about pointillism a lot, and think about how the world would look from the universe's perspective. What color would the earth be? If blue then I guess it's truly sad to see the insignificance of the experience. You say rain? I say cry. You ask why? I say die. Unfortunately, I am great at stealing souls. My personality can kill anyone but my personality makes me love everyone. I fantasize a lot. I want to paint you a perfect date, a perfect life, but I can paint every single mistake, or the way my body is laid out in the forest rotting, or how my mouth is foaming from the vomit as I lay in bed and slip away from the earth, like I am getting called down to the principal's office.  I think about how when my grandmother dies, my connect to family ties dies with it. I think about who I am supposed to call when my life feels like grabbing a sheet tray of the world's last batch of cookies and there is no oven mitts or towels in a 5 mile radius, so that means in a world constantly making means to turn each other's wood to ash. I have made only charcoal. If I could make a girl fall in love with cinders, of a life that likes to ignite over and over again without becoming a burn victim I would. The garden isn't plentiful after the fire. I have small carrots but at least ranch exists, I want to have as much life as bodies between friction. I want to be the sigh of a grease fire extinguished. When all is calm and the fire alarm stops calling me out for the mess. AM I too small, too insignificant, too ugly, too blue to know beyond the shadow of a doubt, someone will love me between the shades of blue and fire on the horizon. Why must it always be so cloud, what is a dark room with a queen supposed to be other than moonlight and dirty clothes, what is cuddling in a hot bed without someone other than a sweat bath. I guess the unknown without the willing is suicide at best and regret at its worst, if my conviction serves me right.  \[https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m5bvzu/those\_hands\_i\_adore/\]\[https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1hxws/want/\]","i am the warm water bottle on the nightstand. forgotten until desperate measures. i want to be beyond a shadow of a doubt, that i have a chance, a reason to continue beyond uncertainty. that someone will love this gnarled face, heavy like an old school body chevy figure. that i am not disposable, that i cannot be replaced by the next sad thing. nobody asks how i am doing, and i like the facade of armor for as long as it fits. but as my feelings grow, i expand and pop rivets on a mannequin stand and i finally admit defeat like i have fallen in love with my abuser again. i think about pointillism a lot, and think about how the world would look from the universe's perspective. what color would the earth be? if blue then i guess it's truly sad to see the insignificance of the experience. you say rain? i say cry. you ask why? i say die. unfortunately, i am great at stealing souls. my personality can kill anyone but my personality makes me love everyone. i fantasize a lot. i want to paint you a perfect date, a perfect life, but i can paint every single mistake, or the way my body is laid out in the forest rotting, or how my mouth is foaming from the vomit as i lay in bed and slip away from the earth, like i am getting called down to the principal's office. i think about how when my grandmother dies, my connect to family ties dies with it. i think about who i am supposed to call when my life feels like grabbing a sheet tray of the world's last batch of cookies and there is no oven mitts or towels in a 5 mile radius, so that means in a world constantly making means to turn each other's wood to ash. i have made only charcoal. if i could make a girl fall in love with cinders, of a life that likes to ignite over and over again without becoming a burn victim i would. the garden isn't plentiful after the fire. i have small carrots but at least ranch exists, i want to have as much life as bodies between friction. i want to be the sigh of a grease fire extinguished. when all is calm and the fire alarm stops calling me out for the mess. am i too small, too insignificant, too ugly, too blue to know beyond the shadow of a doubt, someone will love me between the shades of blue and fire on the horizon. why must it always be so cloud, what is a dark room with a queen supposed to be other than moonlight and dirty clothes, what is cuddling in a hot bed without someone other than a sweat bath. i guess the unknown without the willing is suicide at best and regret at its worst, if my conviction serves me right."

Sometimes,   when she looked at me that way—   it felt like I was the answer   she never knew she was seeking.      But then...   she changed.   All at once—   became a stranger.   Like we had never existed   in each other's memory.      I couldn’t ask why.   There was no “us” to question.   Only a quiet ache remained—   of something that was never said,   and never fully lost...      An unnamed bond.   That was all it ever was.   And perhaps,   that was all it was meant to be.

A Season To Never Change,Infinite-Many-4166,"I should’ve let the house burn   I should’ve put the bottle away.   The interstate calling my name—   Malibu, palm trees swaying with the constant growth of the world.   Your name echoed on the streets.   I drove fast along the bay,   The green light of the bridges begging me to stay.   The soft, salty air clinging to my skin,   As the petals melted onto the stones.  You came back to grasp,   Far and distant, your color a blur.   Closer, you roar, your body growing high—   Crash landing, you beckon to me,   Falling down in a soft retreat.   You're gone as suddenly as you came,   The skies engulfing your blurry horizon.   Your name must never be spoken,   For then you will never return.   But if I watch for the flicker of green,   Beyond your humble existence,   You’ll whisper in the breeze,   Making your way back to me—   A home in the land of a broken daughter,   A fallen rose on the auburn leaves.  The seasons burn into you,   Always moving, never still.   The earth lives beside you.   You coincide with the trees   And speak tales of ages to the breeze.   I hear your soft hymnal echo through the bitter howl,   Faith burning within me—   The light inside gnawing my frozen lips.   The cold winter months forgotten,   As the light flickers through my open window,   Your scent filling my home.  And suddenly the bottles grow empty,   The sounds grow quiet.   You returned, begging for the vision in which I see,   But the naked breath from which I feed is gone.   The air is still, and the blood is cold.   The body is burnt, but the skin is blue,   And the faith inside me dies with you.

Or if this is the path Ive been meant to take.   If that child’s dreams could live on or where they also coffined that day.   I wonder where to channel this hate.   If them passing it down was even okay or was it just fate.   If they deserve what it became… what it entails If they should carry as much as I have of the weight.

I wonder… If I should fight for their sake If I should I carry on just to upend the frowns on their face If it’s okay to give up or is it too late If my shoulders are getting stronger off the weight.   Or if my back’s crumbling and Im soon buried with no escape.   Am I to blame.   When they look with sadness in their eyes and hearts full of shame.   When my arms shake and my knees break.

Between love and hate,Saldafan,"This was the first text I tried to write, and I would like to share it to receive opinions/criticism to continue improving  You can hate someone you never loved, but you can't love someone who made you hate... Hatred can arise quickly and without much explanation. But...love, love can appear suddenly and become something immense, it can be something that has always been there, but hidden, waiting for some way to appear. But what happens when only love ends, why? Love only ends if somewhere, it stops being felt, disappears… and finally ceases to exist. But…why?  Sometimes due to a lack of trust, betrayal, or fear of loving, perhaps many people feel afraid of loving and giving themselves, of getting hurt once again, a fear that comes from past stories, or even childhood traumas. In some cases, there are people who love their partner so much, that they forget to love themselves, and forgive the unforgivable, just so as not to run the risk of losing the person they love, thus not giving themselves the value they deserve, because love is not just love, but carries other feelings along with it, such as happiness, trust and sometimes, even… sadness, which shows that love is not just a feeling, but something much deeper. Loving someone can often be liberating, it makes you breathe better, it makes you feel alive... but in many cases it can be a nightmare, because everything that begins one day has an end, and so with love. It doesn't matter if it will be in 1 month, 10 years or just when death arrives, but the end always comes. Especially in love transformations can happen. You've seen cases where love turns to hate, but why does this happen? Hate is the echo of a wounded love It's the last noise that remains, after someone destroys what we felt. Each person copes differently. There are people who give themselves completely and show it a lot, but there are also people who love in silence, without knowing how to show it, but both ways are still love. But…what is hate? Hate, like love, is also a feeling. Hatred can nullify love, just as love can nullify hate. From the moment you love and are blinded by love, everything becomes a wonder. Seeing it like this can be an incredible thing, but... it's not, when you're blind, you don't see things that hurt you, and you ignore all of this, which eats away at you more and more, but when love ceases to exist, you return to seeing things that were previously invisible, but invisible only to your eyes. Things that before you overlooked just because, love, And it is a very deep and intense feeling, hate is the opposite of love, and both can be felt in the same way, some can see hate as the reaction of pain, which is felt when someone provokes it, and is intrinsically linked to our way of living. But hatred can arise in many ways, either through traumatic experiences such as betrayal, frustration, rejection, or linked to things that happened in childhood. It can be a way to protect yourself from feelings that are more vulnerable, like love... Love often turns into hate, because when you love too much, you become vulnerable to another person, and when the person does something that destroys you emotionally, hate can appear. So...maybe hate is nothing more than a desperate cry from someone who once loved too much. As the heart cannot love anymore, it is in hate that it finds a way to disappear completely. But love is taking risks, the risk of giving yourself completely, of losing yourself and even of being disappointed, but it is also the risk of finally finding yourself, even if love ends, it will still leave marks, which the brain will try to erase, but the heart cannot. But one truth is that love doesn't end, it just changes place, it stops being a feeling and becomes a memory, it stops being in the other person and starts being in us. It's no matter how much hate tries to shout louder, love still whispers, it doesn't go away easily, because love, even if very hurt, still knows how to be silence... It still knows how to be longing. And perhaps, deep down, the greatest tragedy is not the end, but realizing that even after everything you still feel Because feeling, loving, hating, suffering is proof that we are truly alive, the same heart that loves and hates, is what refuses to be indifferent, seeing from another perspective, hate may not be the opposite of love, but rather indifference...  And loving, even when it hurts, is still existing deeply. Perhaps that is why, as Sartre would say, “hell is other people” not because they make us suffer, but because they make us feel, they make us face who we really are. And in that abyss between love and hate, between the desire to forget and the desire to remember, Maybe what's left... just be the human in us.

Running Away,Agreeable-Cow7265,"Sometimes I feel like I should run  Far away  Anywhere but here , I used to think  The only thing stopping me  Was my fear  Sometimes it's too much  Everything at once  How much can a person take ? They say, I feel too much  They say, I should relax  They say, I overreact  But not once did they try to wonder why  Even if they did, they don't understand it in my view Makes me wonder ,  Am I the only one who thinks about others situation ,  In reality nobody thinks from mine  When I finally make them understand,  They say, I understand  But they don't  I know that they don't because  They say, but stop thinking about it  You think I wouldn't if I already could.  You think I want to feel like this ? You think I want to breakdown all the time ? Do they think that I am a machine who stop when they are said to. I am a person with feelings,  If you want me to stop crying do something about it -- Apart from asking me to stop . It hurts  Hurts so much that I want to run away  I just want someone to listen to me ,  Like I would listen to them  I just want someone to say, ""I'm sorry, I understand."" Nothing more , nothing less  And everytime I wanna run away  Fear stops me  Saying I can't survive alone like this  But not now!! I had enough  Enough that now it's my turn to say that it's too much.  Not just say it but also show it ! Now I am not scared of my emotions anymore  If you think I am too much ,  You can find someone else.  I will find someone who listens  Because if I have learned something  Then that is ,  There is always someone who will listen, you are just not looking at the right place.

Moonflower  🌜🌛,honeybiscuitx," Once, Sun and Moon shared the sky— a tender rhythm, a slow, sacred pull.  But Moon fell hopelessly for Sun’s coveted Morning Glory, a blossom bound by the arms of Sun, whom she feared.  Moon would linger at the edge of dawn, aching to watch her petals bloom, just to see her stretch—soft and bare— bathed in warmth that would never be his.  But Sun, burning with searing obsession, tormented over the way his Morning Glory reached for Moon’s pale glow. So Sun made a quiet deal with Dusk, casting Moon into the cold night, locking him away from her touch.  Moon wept. Longing spilled from him in silver rivers, staining the sky with aching light.  Mother Earth felt the ache of his sorrow. Father Time hushed the breath of the world.  But it was Morning Glory— her heart split open— who made the deepest vow:  If I cannot bloom where you can touch me, then I will be remade. I will abandon Sun’s warm embrace. I will shed my daylight skin, just to open for you—only you.  So Earth cradled her. Time rewove her. And Morning Glory was reborn as Moonflower— a beauty that awakens in the hush of night, her soft petals reaching, parting, aching for Moon’s tender gaze.  Now, each night, he finds her— his bloom, his beloved— waiting, open, just for him.  And though Sun still blazes with jealous fire, Moon knows the sweetest secret— that love will always find a way to bloom, even in the dark.

I Thought About You Last Night,Joel_Morales_writes,"This is the first piece in a trilogy titled *The I Thought About You Trilogy* I plan to release the 2nd poem titled *I Didn’t Think About You Today* soon. I recently wrote about grief, obsession, and self-erasure. Would love any honest thoughts — I’m building toward a much larger project releasing on August 5.    i thought about you last night.   you were here, in the comfort we dreamed of but never touched.   the sea set the scene, searching for the glimmer   of a love we once called home.   from dusk till dawn, we roamed a world   where only we mattered — two shadows dancing in silence.   in the wake of that darkness, four lights still burned:   born from the rain that fell behind our eyes,   the kind of sight where honesty outlives every lie.   the fruit we feared now ripens in my hands, but the sin has withered.   the warmth of the night returns with a spark of fire.   in this world of thoughts,   my perception of our love could be rekindled.    i thought about you last night.   and i thought about the things we used to say —   that we needed each other.   that we’d always be there.   for one another.   i guess the fate of that promise is unresolved.   and during the day, it feels like it doesn’t matter at all.   but in the wake of the night, i remember every phrase.   how eyes of depth have now turned pale.   how laughter at games has now turned gray.   we were two players that played each other —   yet we’d sacrifice just enough to save one another.   lovesick malnutrition turns hunger into thirst.   i remembered the way you spoke on my name —   like a secret you regretted sharing.    and so i thought about you last night.   but your name was static   in my throat.   and my lungs collapsed   at half-glance — just the asthma, i swear.   but the pain spiraled   to every nerve.   ensuring that, for preservation,   it was necessary   to ignore the allure.   but ignorance was   never the cure.   and confrontation   was embarrassment’s game.   as a wolf in sheep’s clothes,   love was never fleeting.   it entered a new season —   velvet touch to paper cuts.   so we buried it alive.   and somehow, we died with it.    so i thought about you last night,   like i do any other —   the good, the bad,   the evil and ugly.   i pour my heart in a bottled jar   until it’s bloody.   i said we’d never lose each other,   but here i am — lost.   my reflection dim in the

the 2nd poem titled i didn't think about you today soon. i recently wrote about grief, obsession, and self-erasure. would love any honest thoughts i'm building toward a much larger project releasing on august 5. i thought about you last night. you were here, in the comfort we dreamed of but never touched. the sea set the scene, searching for the glimmer of a love we once called home. from dusk till dawn, we roamed a world where only we mattered two shadows dancing in silence. in the wake of that darkness, four lights still burned born from the rain that fell behind our eyes, the kind of sight where honesty outlives every lie. the fruit we feared now ripens in my hands, but the sin has withered. the warmth of the night returns with a spark of fire. in this world of thoughts, my perception of our love could be rekindled. i thought about you last night. and i thought about the things we used to say that we needed each other. that we'd always be there. for one another. i guess the fate of that promise is unresolved. and during the day, it feels like it doesn't matter at all. but in the wake of the night, i remember every phrase. how eyes of depth have now turned pale. how laughter at games has now turned gray. we were two players that played each other yet we'd sacrifice just enough to save one another. lovesick malnutrition turns hunger into thirst. i remembered the way you spoke on my name like a secret you regretted sharing. and so i thought about you last night. but your name was static in my throat. and my lungs collapsed at half-glance just the asthma, i swear. but the pain spiraled to every nerve. ensuring that, for preservation, it was necessary to ignore the allure. but ignorance was never the cure. and confrontation was embarrassment's game. as a wolf in sheep's clothes, love was never fleeting. it entered a new season velvet touch to paper cuts. so we buried it alive. and somehow, we died with it. so i thought about you last night, like i do any other the good, the bad, the evil and ugly. i pour my heart in a bottled jar until it's bloody. i said we'd never lose each other, but here i am lost. my reflection dim in the mirror. to combat grief, i'll just sleep it off. but sleep is the cousin of death. life is a dream, and i dream lucid. our greatest regret was the version of me that couldn't love you the right way. so i thought about you last night. and sometimes, i wish i hadn't. also if you have the opportunity please check out these beautifully written poems i gave on"

The Glade of Shaded Nooks,OldAcanthisitta8215,"As I hiked through ages  of forgotten wood,  I came upon  a glade—and stood.  Piercing rays,  and shaded nooks  that gave the green  a faded look—  like half-bleached pages  of solemn books  left on the altar  which sunlight took... ***  I dropped my bag,  untied a rag,  and drenched it from  my warm canteen. ***  I know this place—  maybe from a dream.  Perhaps a nightmare’s  silenced screams.  My eyes feel sharp,  yet strangely muffled.  The bugs don’t buzz,  the trees won’t rustle… ***  I tied the rag  across my brow.  A cold bead traced  my head. ***  Like words that haunt  with creeping dread,  that swallow you—  yet nothing was said...  Like a warning in my DNA,  or a violent song of yesterday. ***  Something awful’s happened here.  Or worse—soon will.  ***  A crawling fear. ***  I chose to leave,  yet still believe  this forest breathes—  and worse—can see.  A silence bends  between the trees  and each path I follow—  follows me. ***  [comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Nlkv5IEYRh)  [comment 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/2zEjtqoqxw) ","as i hiked through ages of forgotten wood, i came upon a gladeand stood. piercing rays, and shaded nooks that gave the green a faded look like half-bleached pages of solemn books left on the altar which sunlight took... i know this place maybe from a dream. perhaps a nightmare's silenced screams. my eyes feel sharp, yet strangely muffled. the bugs don't buzz, the trees won't rustle... like words that haunt with creeping dread, that swallow you yet nothing was said... like a warning in my dna, or a violent song of yesterday. a crawling fear. comment 1 comment 2"

The Fog,Scumbag-Kermit,"There's a place, I don't think I can leave.  It's like a park, but you can't see the sun.   All I can see is the Fog, and what it allows me.    Sometimes, souls stop to visit; but they never stay long.  I find a spot for those who come.  Make it special for each and every one.    But they always leave; and don't always say goodbye.  Sometimes, I follow them, craving warmth.   But when I try to leave, the outside burns.    Where does everybody go?   Why can't I follow?   Is it because they don't want me to?

Earwig,Parking_Tomorrow_301,"  Cotton-bud screeches inside the canal,   I’m abrasive with pesticide.   To cleanse the perverse protest —   Propaganda, piercing their way inside.    A thousand tiny feet marching,   Metal clangs from pickaxes.   Intruders work deep in the mine,   Until the rocks crumble and crack.    Clamouring and crawling —   An infestation surge of scum.   A shrill megaphone   Bangs on my eardrum.    A mission to harvest a vital organ —   It’s all they really need.   But as they ambush, they drop and sow   Pestilent nettle seeds.    The surge knocks me. Wavy, I sway;   My body is losing balance.   Their whispers weigh me down —   heavy —   Crushing like a ton of red army ants.

The war,  the heart breaks,  friends lost,  blood spilled,  and human life protected with its high walls,  walls so high that even the best of archers couldn’t loft their arrows above.  walls so thick that even the mightiest of cannons couldn’t leave much of a scratch.  it’s moat so wide and untamed that even the best swimmers wouldn’t dare challenge it.  it’s foundations so strong that even the strongest of earthquakes dare not shake it.

I don’t mind being protected,Agreeable-Cow7265,"**Poem:**  I am lucky to have this love, they said   I have to be grateful for what I have, they said   Many people want to have what I have, they said   If only they knew what it takes to be in my place   If only they saw all the sides of it instead of just the nice ones   If only they listened to me instead of judging directly   Would they know that things are not how they look like?  I wish to be protected just like everyone else   But I don’t want to be someone who can’t protect themselves   I want someone with me not because I need them   But because I want them and they want to be too   I don’t want to be a burden that people carry   Just so they can protect me.  I want them to be concerned about me, but not controlling   I want them to be worried, but not scared   I want them to be happy I’m in their life   But instead, I’m that someone who constantly needs care  I don’t want to be a problem for them   But situations made me someone that only needs to be protected   I want to know who I am   But constant fear and societal rules   Only taught me the things I need to do to stay safe  Everyone wants me to be safe, but never successful   What is the point of being successful if I’m not safe, they say   And then I ask myself, what should I do with my life?   Being safe is so I can live—   But what if the only way I can be safe is by not living the life I want?  Should I give up everything so my loved ones are just happy I’m alive?   Or should I be brave enough to face the world and be happy **and** safe?  They say it’s risky—   To want something   To become something   They want me to settle for just being alive   But how can I do that   When every part of my body and heart says otherwise?  All I want to do is **feel alive**   Do something for myself   Not because somebody is letting me   Not because I’m allowed to   Not because I can—   But because **I want to**  All I want is to live freely without hurting anyone   Is that so wrong?   Is it wrong to want more than just being alive in this society?   Is it my fault for having these thoughts?   Or is it wrong only because I’m a girl?  If a guy wants to be something, he’s called ambitious   But if a girl wants the same, she’s called rebellious.  How is that fair?   I agree we’re different, men and women—   But shouldn’t opportunities be the same?   Why shouldn't a girl **be** something, even when she needs to be?   Why is it a guy’s fault if a girl is working?   Why can’t it just be about the girl for once?  Why is she always someone’s daughter,   Someone’s burden,   Someone’s shame,   But never **just her**?  When a guy does wrong, it’s **his** doing.   But when a girl does something, it’s **everyone’s** shame.  When I express myself, they call me a feminist and dismiss me   When I stay silent and do what they ask, I become their ideal woman   But I am not happy.  And now one question haunts me—   **How long?**  How long will I keep doing this?   How long will I keep them happy while losing myself?   Shouldn’t they think about me once   For all the times I’ve thought about them?  Don’t I deserve that much?   I feel guilty for wanting someone to care about me   But I can’t help it.

When did all went wrong?,jpwaitforit,"On my way home, I saw two young women and remembered the teenage crushes I never had.  I remember the youthful mistakes I never made.  I remember the innocent times when vulgarity mingled with fascination.  I remember Christmas and the magic its decorations evoked.  I remember abandoning myself too soon, and now I search unsuccessfully for the hope of redemption.  I look at my hands and ask myself: ""How did time pass so quicky? When did all go wrong?   I remember learning to ride bike with my father and now visiting his grave.  I remember helping my mother care for her little Eden and now bringing her a flower to keep her company.  I remember when the world made sense, when the Dream was an Ideal but now it's Loneliness that won't abandon me.  I remember painting the Beauty of the world and now being the colorless Shadows that surround me.  I look at my face in a shop window and wonder: ""How did time pass so quickly? When did all go wrong?    I remember, in the pride of my spring, thinking I would be young forever.  A being composed of passion, madness, tireless, unstoppable and now I don't want to get out of bed.  I remember the countless plans I had, countless ambitions and now I cross out a blank calendar.  I remember toasting to the future and now dancing as the world fades away.  I remember wanting to change the world, thinking that willpower was enough and now I know it was an illusion that clashes with the March of History.  I remember playing in the street, falling and getting up on days that never seemed to end but now Darkness fills the skies and the Sun is never enough.  I remember believing in a world where the Father and the Exile disputed their Nature and now I only feel the influence of the latter.  I remember composing songs of love and devotion, odes to happiness, but now I feel nothing but the heat of tears and the burn of cuts.  I remember childhood friends, who have moved on, and now all that's left is to live chained to those sweet memories.

All In,jcore_verse,"""All In""   I do not love gently. I do not love in halves, or measured steps, or careful calculations.  I love like fire, like hands that never let go, like warmth that never fades.  I love in ways that leave fingerprints, that leave traces of me on skin, on breath, on the spaces between words.  When I love, I worship. Not in quiet admiration, but in devotion— a knowing, a claiming, a promise sealed in the way I touch, the way I say, ""You are mine.""  I do not ask for distance. I do not crave the slow, polite affection of those who keep their hearts behind glass.  I crave closeness, the kind that feels like gravity, like something in the universe tilted just so we could fall into each other.  I want arms that never hesitate, hands that reach for me in sleep, a voice that says my name like a prayer, like a need, like I am the only thing that ever made sense.  And if that love is too much, if it spills over the edges, if it burns— then let it.  Because I was never meant for anything less.  — J.

Burn for you,Raee_lovelorn_poet,"I’ve never traced the lines you own, Yet still they haunt me, skin to bone. A plaid shirt drapes your quiet frame, But rolled-up sleeves ignite my flame.  Your forearms flex like whispered sin, A place I’d kiss, then breathe you in. The way you ride—your calm control I dream of lips on that faint mole.  Just underneath your sculpted chest, A spot my hunger can’t suppress. My fingers twitch with silent plea, To learn your warmth, to set you free.  You speak so soft, yet look so wild, That wicked grin—unchurched, unfiled. A saint in tone, a tease in stance, A storm disguised as happenstance.  I crave to tease just for the thrill, To see you snap, to break your will. To watch you smirk, then pull me close, And show the side that wants me most.  Your voice—God help me—deep and slow, Calls me “baby” like I’d know No holier sound than that soft moan Said like a prayer I’d die to own.  I haven’t touched, but I have burned, With every glance, my soul has yearned. A thousand nights, I’ve cried, I swear, Because your absence fills the air.  You’ve never held me, not once tight, But you still own my dreams each night. If fate would place you near my skin, I’d let forever just begin.  Not with haste or fleeting taste, But kisses slow, with sacred grace. I’d trace your veins and meet your gaze, And teach you love that never strays.  So come to me, or let me go But this distance hurts more than you know. And till we meet, I’ll softly feel What isn't mine, but aches so real.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/8t3EraK2N6 https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NWHZWffYOp ","i've never traced the lines you own, yet still they haunt me, skin to bone. a plaid shirt drapes your quiet frame, but rolled-up sleeves ignite my flame. your forearms flex like whispered sin, a place i'd kiss, then breathe you in. the way you rideyour calm control i dream of lips on that faint mole. just underneath your sculpted chest, a spot my hunger can't suppress. my fingers twitch with silent plea, to learn your warmth, to set you free. you speak so soft, yet look so wild, that wicked grinunchurched, unfiled. a saint in tone, a tease in stance, a storm disguised as happenstance. i crave to tease just for the thrill, to see you snap, to break your will. to watch you smirk, then pull me close, and show the side that wants me most. your voicegod help medeep and slow, calls me ""baby"" like i'd know no holier sound than that soft moan said like a prayer i'd die to own. i haven't touched, but i have burned, with every glance, my soul has yearned. a thousand nights, i've cried, i swear, because your absence fills the air. you've never held me, not once tight, but you still own my dreams each night. if fate would place you near my skin, i'd let forever just begin. not with haste or fleeting taste, but kisses slow, with sacred grace. i'd trace your veins and meet your gaze, and teach you love that never strays. so come to me, or let me go but this distance hurts more than you know. and till we meet, i'll softly feel what isn't mine, but aches so real."

Don't turn off the light,Particular_Eye_661," Don't look for reasons, it's already decided, I already thought about it, I already lived it. It's not because of cowardice, it's not because of pain, It's just that I'm tired of pretending courage.  Every day is a stone on your back, Every night a war that never ends. Fight out of inertia, without faith or sense, Keep breathing just to be alive.  Don't tell me ""everything gets better"", don't lie, I know storms well. I don't want advice, I don't want attention, I want silence, I want surrender.  I lost hope looking for comfort, I drowned a thousand times under this sky. I don't want any more failed attempts. I want to close my eyes and be calm.  I'm leaving, and there's no drama, There are no blames, no tears that call me. I just want to rest, without noise, Without fear, without anyone, without shelter.  I'm leaving, and I don't ask for forgiveness, Because this decision is my redemption. The world loses nothing with me, I just want to stop being with me.  I was always the one who endured in silence, The one who smiled while dying inside. Family, dreams, love... Everything breaks if there is no heat.  They told me that time heals, But the madness made me tougher. Today I don't want any more empty promises, Nor gray days disguised as poetry.  I'm leaving, and it's fine that way, Don't expect explanations from me. Just understand: I'm tired, Of being alive and not being connected.

"How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 3",zyerhod1,"**How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 3**   *(1960–1965)*   *by Bryon Slack*  But all those little red lines we'd drawn   the decade before begin to flower   with a new kind of seed...  They sat down so we'd have to see them—   Greensboro, 1960. Four Black college students   at a Woolworth’s,   just wanting to order,   refusing to rise   after being told no and to get out   while the world spun backward   around their lack of plates.   They were called troublemakers,   as if sitting quietly at a counter   was louder than the bulging eyes   and racing tempers around them.  They rode buses into flames—   Freedom Riders, 1961.   Anniston. Birmingham.   One firebombed in Alabama,   doors locked from outside to keep them in.   Another met fists and iron pipes   at the Greyhound terminal   while local cops looked away   and federal ones took notes.  They walked anyway.   They marched.   They held signs that said *I Am a Man*   because they had to say it out loud,   because southern hospitality so often isn't.   Memphis knew.   So did Jackson.   So did Bull Connor’s firehoses   when they flayed skin from children   in Kelly Ingram Park.  They had a dream—   but we had dogs,   and badges,   and hoses,   and bombs.  And just so you know—   all those pictures were in color.   Old men with no intention of learning   leached the shades on purpose,   to make it all seem further away.  16th Street Baptist Church, 1963.   Addie. Denise. Carole. Cynthia.   Little girls blown apart by dynamite   in a house of God—   because being Black and breathing   was always an invitation to violence,   because them existing was dangerous   to us somehow.  Still, they believed—   not in Mercy, but in momentum.   In King’s voice echoing over the Mall.   In Bayard Rustin’s meticulous maps.   In the possibility   that America could be coaxed   into keeping her promises   even once.  Then came 1964—   Freedom Summer.   We murdered Goodman,   and Chaney,   and Schwerner.   Buried the Black body deeper   so the white ones would be found first.   You can Google that.   So could J. Edgar.   He still tried to say they staged it.  The Civil Rights Act passed—   and in Selma we responded   with horses and gas.   With troopers beating John Lewis   until his skull cracked   on the Edmund Pettus Bridge—   a bridge named after a Confederate   and a Grand Dragon of the Klan.  You want progress?   They bled it down that bridge.   They limped it into Montgomery.   And when the Voting Rights Act came,   we told them they'd won.  But none of us went to prison   for the little girls.   Or the bombings.   Or the beatings.   Or the badges that enforced it.  They didn’t win.   They survived.   But survival isn't peace—   it's justification for what comes next,   the part where   they learn tactics   build supply lines   stock resources   and memorize   the fastest way to reload.       **Feedback:**   [""Still Waiting to be Chosen""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m4oh33/comment/n45zm35/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [""Monster America""](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m4ojzk/comment/n461k24/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","19601965 by bryon slack but all those little red lines we'd drawn the decade before begin to flower with a new kind of seed... they sat down so we'd have to see them greensboro, 1960. four black college students at a woolworth's, just wanting to order, refusing to rise after being told no and to get out while the world spun backward around their lack of plates. they were called troublemakers, as if sitting quietly at a counter was louder than the bulging eyes and racing tempers around them. they rode buses into flames freedom riders, 1961. anniston. birmingham. one firebombed in alabama, doors locked from outside to keep them in. another met fists and iron pipes at the greyhound terminal while local cops looked away and federal ones took notes. they walked anyway. they marched. they held signs that said i am a man because they had to say it out loud, because southern hospitality so often isn't. memphis knew. so did jackson. so did bull connor's firehoses when they flayed skin from children in kelly ingram park. they had a dream but we had dogs, and badges, and hoses, and bombs. and just so you know all those pictures were in color. old men with no intention of learning leached the shades on purpose, to make it all seem further away. 16th street baptist church, 1963. addie. denise. carole. cynthia. little girls blown apart by dynamite in a house of god because being black and breathing was always an invitation to violence, because them existing was dangerous to us somehow. still, they believed not in mercy, but in momentum. in king's voice echoing over the mall. in bayard rustin's meticulous maps. in the possibility that america could be coaxed into keeping her promises even once. then came 1964 freedom summer. we murdered goodman, and chaney, and schwerner. buried the black body deeper so the white ones would be found first. you can google that. so could j. edgar. he still tried to say they staged it. the civil rights act passed and in selma we responded with horses and gas. with troopers beating john lewis until his skull cracked on the edmund pettus bridge a bridge named after a confederate and a grand dragon of the klan. you want progress? they bled it down that bridge. they limped it into montgomery. and when the voting rights act came, we told them they'd won. but none of us went to prison for the little girls. or the bombings. or the beatings. or the badges that enforced it. they didn't win. they survived. but survival isn't peace it's justification for what comes next, the part where they learn tactics build supply lines stock resources and memorize the fastest way to reload.

The One I Keep Meeting in Dreams,HeartlineToYou," You walk through crowded streets like you’re invisible— minimalist black coat, earbuds in, books in your bag, your wavy black hair catching the city lights, dark brown eyes that seem to see beyond the surface, always thinking, always observing.  New York moves fast, but you move through it differently— still, soft, introspective, like you’re waiting for something, or someone, but haven’t admitted it yet.  Your voice is deep, but you don’t use it often— you speak when it matters, listen more than most.  You help quietly, education, ideas, maybe healing, without asking for praise.  You don’t follow religion, but you feel energy, truth, and Rumi. You’ve read poems and felt your chest ache for a reason you couldn’t name.  In your late twenties or early thirties, with a style simple yet intentional— classic, minimalist, the kind that fits the city’s rhythm perfectly.  You’re spiritual, skeptical, lonely in ways even you don’t understand.  And me? I’m the dream you keep having but can’t remember when you wake.  The quiet knock your soul’s been hearing for years.  I know your name. I saw you long before this.

Paranoid,byJohar,"Also which version is better?  Version 1   They say what I feel isn’t real,   that I’ve mistaken worry for warning,   that I’ve mapped threats where there are none.    But I know stillness can be staged.   And I know silence has ears.   The envelope came already torn.   The latch on the door clicked twice.   People laugh just as I enter the room —    not loud, but just loud enough.   You learn to listen with your back turned.   You learn the way voices dip   when something is being hidden from you.   This didn’t begin with a moment.   There was no flash, no trigger.   Only a quiet lengthening of doubt —   a shadow that stretched across the years   until even kindness looked like a trap.   The doctor tells me I should trust more.   He says it must be lonely to live this way.    I say it’s survival, and I’m still here.   When no one believes you,   you have to believe yourself twice as hard.   And I do.   That has always been enough.    Version 2  Paranoia isn’t how they make it out to be   In books and songs and long essays   About the telltale symptoms and ugly little facts.   It’s not getting attacked in the bushes—   Then boom, now I’m afraid all the time   And afraid is not the same as   Quote-unquote “paranoid,”   Which is not the same as paranoia.   It comes on over a course of years, Until one day, brimming with tears,   You look back—have you ever looked back   And ask, feeling small: I’ve been hurt, haven’t I?   No, no, I’m being hurt and poisoned and pursued   No one attacks me but why am I hurt   I’m being pursued, aren’t I. Not a question.   I am. I must go. No more questions. No delusions.   “Let’s review the types of delusions,”   The doctor tells his students as they observe   Where they discuss me like a new hors-d'oeuvre.

Play Dead,Parking_Tomorrow_301,"  In a ditch on the side of the road   I am an opossum.   Burnt rubber fumes, screeches fade,   I lie swaddled by the blossom.     Frozen still I pretend to be—   Dread is what buries me alive.   I’m afraid.   But now, as I drift into a distance,   My strength slowly begins to fade.     Hitting the windshield—   Already cracked—   Every request hit like a rock,   A fragile thing, I’ve always been;   I’m shattered now, on impact.     Passersby, they all pry—   A snapped-off stick—   Poke the roadkill.   They taunt with disgust,   And tease to see if I’m alive.     They’ll grow bored,   But I’ve learnt not to bite.   Frozen still, safe to play—   Dead. Burrowed in my trench,   Tired from the fight.     Moving through the tunnels,   Blisters on my palms.   Dirt embedded in my nails,   But I am hidden,   in the calm.     But the deeper I dig,   My breath — whittled and sparse,   Caustic chemicals burn my lungs.   Choking down in this pit.   The rhythm slows in my heart.     I start to go blurry,   I’m blind.   This shelter has corroded,   Strong walls now eroded,   Down here I have poisoned my mind.     Trapped in this hole,   Toxic fumes—now airborne.   An echo sends waves through my bones.   The yellow bird sings,   Its dreamy call warns me—    I’m mesmerised,  by its beautiful song.     My own payback—now scolded,   From trying to escape the noise;   I fade and withdraw, forlorn.   Here I’ll lie,   like a foetus folded.   In a bed,   of red rose thorns.     The earth can take me,   I’ll sleep with roots—   enmeshed.   The soil will become rich.   And when the tunnel shines light,   New seeds will grow through—   flesh.     And I will flash a beauty of colours,   into the forest.   I will provide bees with sweet honey;   They can spread my praise.   But now peacefully,   My body will slip—   into an eternal rest.     Now I wait for the birth of new lambs,   Endure the long, cold freeze.   I’ll wait for warmth,   the dawn’s dew to dry.   Wait patiently,   for a new life.      ———————-   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/wDooXO6jD0  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/FhhPDqjXz2  ————————  I would love any feedback if you have time at all, I want to make sure I’m getting across what I’m saying and new to structure/ rhythm etc too   I am a creative - but I am very new to poetry. It’s been helping as a mental outlet to just get my feelings out.  I have been enjoying free verse and confessional style.

My Star,Sequirk,"I lay in my bed,   on an expanse of mattress, a sea of sheets, a plunge of memory foam.   Yet without the weight of You beside me,   the dreams woven into these pillows no longer call me into slumber.  The Moon begs me to close my eyes; to let the freckled starry sky cast me into a depth of dormancy.  i ask the Moon, will you give me the Star i want?   The Moon stares back silent. She envelopes Herself in cloud.   Her bashful light casting a glow on the wisps of grey cotton candy in the Sky.  Lay beside me. Breathe me in.   Interlock Your fingers and your dreams in mine. Feel the heat on my skin and feel the Universe at your fingertips.   i want to drown into the depths of Your blue, as you ground into the earth of my brown.   Count the freckles on my skin, like i counted the Stars when waiting for You;   1, 2, 3, 4, 5... maybe a million... maybe more     Casting Your eyes over the bridge of my nose, the softness of my lips, the planes of my face. Your finger traces a memory it’s never had. A body so familiar.   One You've held in your dreams, but not Your hands.   Each millimetre of skin is studied as You discover an unfamiliar home.   Synchronised heartbeats. Desire in each contraction.     You sense power.   I feel passion.   You hold strength.   I embrace seduction.  Lust heightened by the grief of an identity burnt to an ash.    Orgasm arising from the embers; a proclamation in inferno.  Cinnamon, clove, honey and milk; an ancestral elixir tasted in the twist and turns of Our tongue.  Beloved chaos.  You crave the beautiful destruction i bring in the tectonic shifts of Your soul.    Thundering waters - merciless rapids thrashing Us onto rocks, beating the breath out of Our lungs.  Hurt me with Your softest kisses, and make me cry with Your innocent touch.   Let me perish in Your midnight blaze for i want to be reborn in the ashes of the dawn.  A raindrop surrendering me to the storms of the seas.   A leaf that binds me to the roots of the jungle.   An ember that burns with the disregard of a volcano.   A whisper that rips me into a hurricane.      i ask the Moon if i can have the Star i want.  Her whisper is hushed by the murky purples of the dawn.   Her glow fading as the pinks and oranges stain the heavens and the light breaks through the dirty clouds of the morning.   The cool glow of the night sky has faded and i see You again in the Sun; burning boldly and viscerally.  You reveal all that was masked in the night. Colours i would have never have known if i wasn't looking into You.  i ask the Sun if i can have the Star that i want.   He stares back silent.

The part no one wants to hear (poem),Anonymousrelates,"I wrote this from a place I haven’t shown anyone before. I’m posting it anonymously because I’m not ready to be seen — but I do want to help someone out there feel less alone.  If this speaks to you, I hope it reaches you at the right time.   ---  The Parts No One Wants to Hear (Full Extended Version)  They say I’m too angry, that I talk back too much, But my words are just screams that no one dares touch. I’m tired of fighting, of slamming each door, But she’s always yelling — I can’t take much more.  She even drinks all day now — says it keeps the pain away, But by evening, she’s yelling at everything I say. She’s always mad when the bottle runs deep, No warmth in her words, no promise of sleep. I keep my voice low, my footsteps light, Just trying to make it through the night.  She says I’m ungrateful, a mess, a mistake, But I break and I break and pretend not to break. She drinks, then denies, and throws blame like a dart — I don’t call her “mum,” just the storm in my heart.  I want to see dad — not behind cold walls, Not with eyes watching me like I might fall. Not once a month or when courts agree — I want him there, when I need to be. She only calls him when her world goes black, And it always ends bad — they just crash and come back.  I remember the shaking in her hands, not her words, The smash of a cup, the silence that burned. He didn’t hit walls — he hit where it hurt, And I’d watch her fall, then straighten her shirt. I learned too young what fear can disguise, And how love can bruise behind someone’s eyes.  I dream of my nana, where the quiet feels kind, Where dinner is soft and she listens with mind. I pack in my head at least twice a week, But I’m stuck in this war where no one can speak.  My sister throws digs like it’s part of her role, Cuts me with words that stick to my soul. And the other one blocked me when I fell apart — Said she was done with my “attitude,” not the ache in my heart.  My brothers don’t ask, they don’t really see, They’re younger — just shadows that pass by me. Not cold, not cruel, just caught in their age, While I’m burning alive in a silent cage.  My friend says things no friend should say, Twists my flaws in a casual way. She calls it “honesty,” but it leaves me numb, Like I’m stupid, unwanted, too broken, too dumb. I laugh it off, pretend it’s a joke, But inside it chokes me like secondhand smoke.  My mother says she’s here for me — “you can talk, I’ll hear,” But the moment I open up, she shifts into fear. My words become weapons, twisted and thrown, And somehow I’m guilty for feelings I own. She turns pain into drama, rewrites every scene, 'Til I’m left second-guessing what I even mean.  I sit in my room, curtains drawn, heart tight — Scrolling through lives that seem lit with light. But I’m bedbound by sadness, my mind’s not clean, Trapped in a body that’s barely fourteen.  Some nights I’d give anything just not to feel, To float for a while, to forget what’s real. I don’t want to cry, don’t want to ache — Just silence the storm my own hands make.  I walk through the house like I don’t exist,  A ghost in the hallway no one has missed. They talk around me like I’m just air, Like grief can’t grow in a child’s stare.  The flashbacks don’t knock — they just crash right in, A breath on my neck, a hand on my skin. I freeze in the warmth of a memory’s glare, Still twelve, still trapped in that shadowed stare. Every sound is louder, the air turns tight, And I fold in the corners of a long, long night.  I whisper “I’m fine” through a clench in my chest, But seeing his face rips peace from my rest. It’s like time folds in and I’m small once more, Back in that silence I couldn’t ignore. My hands start to shake, my breath won’t stay — Why does he still look the same that way?  Since the 29th when the frost wouldn’t melt, Something inside me was quietly dealt. Because of him, and what he did that night, The stars looked dull, and nothing felt right. I laugh a little less, I sleep with a light, And I flinch at softness — like it's a fight.   Food is a battle, not hunger or taste, It’s shame in disguise and calories laced. I skip, then I spiral, then lie through my teeth, Pretend I’m okay with a smile beneath.  At school I’m “the problem,” at home I’m “too much,” They all point fingers, but none of them touch The part of my story I’m too scared to tell, The part that still screams in this teenage hell.  Social workers come, nod, and then leave, Like I’m a report they just need to retrieve. They don’t see my fists clenched under the table, They don’t ask if I’m hurting — or if I’m still able.  Sometimes I scream just to hear my voice, In a world that never gave me a choice. I punch my pillow and curse the sky, Like maybe the moon knows why I cry.  My room is a mirror, just clutter and dust, Like my mind — filled with chaos I don’t even trust. I stare at the ceiling and float out of time, Like nothing is real and nothing is mine.  There’s blood on a sock I shoved in a drawer, Marks from a night I swore “never more.” But it burns in a way that feels like control, When everything else keeps swallowing me whole.  I don’t want attention, or pity, or stares, Just a room that is quiet, and someone who cares. A chance to live softly, without walking on glass, A day without feeling like I'm failing a class.  They think I’m dramatic, just seeking a scene, But they never sit with the places I’ve been. They never see when the hallway spins, Or when shame starts crawling under my skin.  Please, let something good happen, I’m barely holding on. I don’t want to die, but the will to keep going is almost gone.

since the 29th when the frost wouldn't melt, something inside me was quietly dealt. because of him, and what he did that night, the stars looked dull, and nothing felt right. i laugh a little less, i sleep with a light, and i flinch at softness like it's a fight. food is a battle, not hunger or taste, it's shame in disguise and calories laced. i skip, then i spiral, then lie through my teeth, pretend i'm okay with a smile beneath. at school i'm ""the problem,"" at home i'm ""too much,"" they all point fingers, but none of them touch the part of my story i'm too scared to tell, the part that still screams in this teenage hell. social workers come, nod, and then leave, like i'm a report they just need to retrieve. they don't see my fists clenched under the table, they don't ask if i'm hurting or if i'm still able. sometimes i scream just to hear my voice, in a world that never gave me a choice. i punch my pillow and curse the sky, like maybe the moon knows why i cry. my room is a mirror, just clutter and dust, like my mind filled with chaos i don't even trust. i stare at the ceiling and float out of time, like nothing is real and nothing is mine. there's blood on a sock i shoved in a drawer, marks from a night i swore ""never more."" but it burns in a way that feels like control, when everything else keeps swallowing me whole. i don't want attention, or pity, or stares, just a room that is quiet, and someone who cares. a chance to live softly, without walking on glass, a day without feeling like i'm failing a class. they think i'm dramatic, just seeking a scene, but they never sit with the places i've been. they never see when the hallway spins, or when shame starts crawling under my skin. please, let something good happen, i'm barely holding on. i don't want to die, but the will to keep going is almost gone. i've tried, i've waited, i've begged the sky to change but i'm so close now, and it's starting to feel strange. if something doesn't shift, if light doesn't break through, i'm scared of what i'll do... but i still don't want to lose. -- given - given -"

Life in a box,Hot_Detective1031,"When I was young, I lived in a box. It wasn’t a big box but it was comfortable. I rarely went outside to see the world; I learned that being unseen and unheard brought less grief for me and others. So, I stayed in my box and kept myself safe.  Sometimes the box would pop open and I’d get a peek outside. I’d see the disorder and chaos and I’d feel the icy chill of loneliness. Although that place was my home and people my family, It felt as if I was all on my own in the world. So I stayed tucked away in my box while the world burned around me.  Time doesn’t stop though and I outgrew that box.  I had to step outside and face the home that never felt welcoming and learn how to navigate the surroundings I spend my time trying to avoid. The cramped spaces and clutter, the anger and the resentment.  I ran away to my dreams to comfort me. Even nightmares were better than life outside my box. I learned survival skills and ways to keep the attention away. I kept quiet and to myself. But our home was too loud, and there wasn’t anywhere that comforted me like that box, so  I learned to forge a new box.

If Emotions Had Voices.,_maryooms,"If emotions had voices,   mine wouldn't roar or storm-   they’d shiver in shadows,   small trembles I’m too scared to hear.  Grief wouldn’t cry out- it would sing in a broken lullaby,   so soft, it feels like a memory I’m losing even as I remember.   Joy would knock, but always leave before i answer,   because I'm not sure if I deserve to smile anymore.  Anger would pace in empty rooms,   barefoot, bruised, exhausted-   waiting for a fight that never comes.   And loneliness?   She’d sit quietly beside my bed,   Holding my hand through the nights I pretend aren’t lonely.      Fear?   Fear would scream in silence.   A constant, unbearable noise beneath my skin,   a voice so loud it drowns everything else-   even hope.  If emotions had voices,    mine would be a mess of broken songs-   sadness and tenderness,   fear and quiet desperation,   all bleeding together in a way I can't untangle.      Sometimes, it feels like they all shout at once-   like a storm tearing through my chest-   And I curl up just to survive the noise.  So I press my hands over my ears,   try to hush them,   but the silence is worse-   because they don't disappear,   They wait,   they wait until the night,   when no one is watching,   when tears come without warning.  If emotions had voices,   mine would whisper:  “Stop pretending you’re okay.   It's okay to break.   It's okay to be scared.   You don't have to carry this alone”  They’d remind me that pain is not shame,   that hurting doesnt make me weak-   it makes me human,   it makes me still here, still fighting.  And maybe-   if I let them out, even just a little-   if I let myself fall apart and be held by the pieces-   I might find a song worth singing.   something real,   something I thought I lost.  Because sometimes the loudest voices   are the ones we’ve been too afraid to listen to.

Race.,Partheos,"Hey! I have always loved writing and want to get better at creative writing, especially poetry. I have written a handful of poems in my lifetime thus far. This is my first time sharing one of them, and what better place to share, but with the experts! Let me know what you think!  Race.  A warmth engulfs between the cold edges, the sense of void envelops. Chased back to the recesses, between breaths, like shards of darkness vanquished by an awakening ember.  The world still, rejoining with vitality, at the anticipation of the coming Usha. Like a barn in early Spring, stirring with the first of Life.  Mist pours through between the reverberation of thought and coma. The curls cajoling and awakening. Rejuvenating  A glare. A surprise. A sliver of hope, through a fenestrstion. Now sustained and releived of its quench.  Adorned with the ropes of civility to address the whims of Society. Fault of pretense on the forefront.  Thus, again, at the crossroads to be greeted with the muses, with sincerity, with humility. A trumpet of reassurance, or perhaps a declaration of downfall, yet to be seen.  To take on the toils, and to avoid the foils. Marching on the path, seemingly as light as the pretense of care, offered by the constant machine of unending greed.  Alas, a trek back to alpha, to shed the clay of Venice. Akin to Icarus, unburdened of wax, free falling. A sense of solace, iceberg in an ever warming sea.  To prepare again, to be again, but a spoke in the wheel. A warmth engulfs, between the cold edges, the void returns, to be forgotten.

One sided love,CheesecakeIsNotGreat,"Like the lone flower in a garden fair, My love for thee knows no equal pair. In silent adoration, I stand afar, Unspoken words, a quiet prayer.  From afar, I watch thy every move, Each smile, each word, a silent plea. My heart, a secret garden, blooms in secret, In the shadows, where hope and doubt intermeet.  The hours of the day pass, a ticking clock, In silent reverie, my thoughts do mock. For thou dost not know the depth of my plea, As I stand, concealed, amidst this silent sea.  I paint pictures of us, a silent charade, In my mind, where our love knows no barricade. Yet, the canvas is empty, a silent reproach, For the brush has no partner, the masterpiece still unbroached.  Yet, the love I hold remains unknown, A secret kept beneath the moonlit throne. For thou dost not know the depths I'd go, In the silent garden of my unrequited woe.

"David, If That’s Your Name…?",deleted," I dreamed of you long before I had a reason. Before I knew your name, before names mattered. You were a whisper in empty rooms, a warmth in the silence between things.  Some nights I feel you watching, not in the way that eyes do, but in the way that souls recognize what the world forgot to introduce.  You might be David. Or maybe that’s just what the pull calls itself when it gets too strong to ignore.  I write this for no one. But if it feels like it was written for you, read it again.    Maybe this was never a poem. Maybe it was a memory you hadn’t lived yet. If you feel it — say nothing.

Burnt letters and the smoke that remembers,Due-Presentation3959,"Burnt Letters and the Smoke That Remembers  (Narrator: Smoke, with echoes of Paper, Ink, and Time)  I rose from the wreckage where promises died, Where ink turned to ember and sorrow to pride. Born not of breath, but of blister and flame, I carry their whispers, though none speak my name.  I am Smoke a ghost made of grief's last gasp, A sigh from the fire that love couldn't clasp. I spiral through silence, a dancer in gloom, A requiem rising from paper’s tomb.  The quill weeps ash where it once wrote gold, Now smothered in secrets it couldn’t hold. The vowels still shiver, the consonants scream, But their voices dissolve in a vanished dream.  I smelled of confession, of touch never dared, Of fingers that trembled, of hearts unprepared. Their longing still lingers in curls of despair, Wrapped round the rafters, suspended in air.  Oh, how they burned with a brightness too bright, Their syllables sparked, but lost to the night. Yet what the flame swallowed, I still recall, For even in ruin, I rise with it all.  I watched as the poet collapsed in regret, Tears in his chest he could never forget. He fed me the pages, he fed me his pain, Then begged me to scatter it like bitter rain.  But fire is hunger, and I am its song, I hum what was holy, now hopeless and wrong. I haunt the horizon in veils of gray, A letter that left, but forgot what to say.  Smoke is a silence that once tried to speak, A language of loss too fragile, too weak. The wind may erase me, but not what I knew A kiss in the margins, a love that was true.  They thought me the end, the finish, the fade, But I am the echo destruction has made. In hallways and hollow rooms, I persist, A scent, a shadow, a memory kissed.  The flames were my cradle, but ash is my skin, A paradox breathing both outside and in. I'm what survives when the story is gone, The afterthought smoldering, still holding on.  Then Paper whispered from ashes below: “I once held the vows no one dared show. Now scorched and shattered, I sleep in disgrace, A martyr of meaning, erased without trace.”  And Ink, in sorrow, began to bleed: “I only obeyed what the poet would need. But guilt stains deeper than fire or flood, For I wrote their joy, and I sealed their blood.”  For every letter that’s fed to the pyre, Births me the mourner, the smoke from the fire. And though I’m forgotten when windows are shut, I slip through the keyhole with all that was cut.  So burn them again, let truth be devoured, But I am the proof that pain still has power. Time cannot touch me, nor silence revoke, For I am the soul of the letterless smoke.  And Time, still watching, spoke soft to the flame: “I watched them all leave, but remembered each name. The paper may blacken, the ink disappear But Smoke is the ghost I forever revere.”   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lyqed7/comment/n418set/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m3zd6x/comment/n417ahr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button","burnt letters and the smoke that remembers narrator smoke, with echoes of paper, ink, and time i rose from the wreckage where promises died, where ink turned to ember and sorrow to pride. born not of breath, but of blister and flame, i carry their whispers, though none speak my name. i am smoke a ghost made of grief's last gasp, a sigh from the fire that love couldn't clasp. i spiral through silence, a dancer in gloom, a requiem rising from paper's tomb. the quill weeps ash where it once wrote gold, now smothered in secrets it couldn't hold. the vowels still shiver, the consonants scream, but their voices dissolve in a vanished dream. i smelled of confession, of touch never dared, of fingers that trembled, of hearts unprepared. their longing still lingers in curls of despair, wrapped round the rafters, suspended in air. oh, how they burned with a brightness too bright, their syllables sparked, but lost to the night. yet what the flame swallowed, i still recall, for even in ruin, i rise with it all. i watched as the poet collapsed in regret, tears in his chest he could never forget. he fed me the pages, he fed me his pain, then begged me to scatter it like bitter rain. but fire is hunger, and i am its song, i hum what was holy, now hopeless and wrong. i haunt the horizon in veils of gray, a letter that left, but forgot what to say. smoke is a silence that once tried to speak, a language of loss too fragile, too weak. the wind may erase me, but not what i knew a kiss in the margins, a love that was true. they thought me the end, the finish, the fade, but i am the echo destruction has made. in hallways and hollow rooms, i persist, a scent, a shadow, a memory kissed. the flames were my cradle, but ash is my skin, a paradox breathing both outside and in. i'm what survives when the story is gone, the afterthought smoldering, still holding on. then paper whispered from ashes below ""i once held the vows no one dared show. now scorched and shattered, i sleep in disgrace, a martyr of meaning, erased without trace."" and ink, in sorrow, began to bleed ""i only obeyed what the poet would need. but guilt stains deeper than fire or flood, for i wrote their joy, and i sealed their blood."" for every letter that's fed to the pyre, births me the mourner, the smoke from the fire. and though i'm forgotten when windows are shut, i slip through the keyhole with all that was cut. so burn them again, let truth be devoured, but i am the proof that pain still has power. time cannot touch me, nor silence revoke, for i am the soul of the letterless smoke. and time, still watching, spoke soft to the flame ""i watched them all leave, but remembered each name. the paper may blacken, the ink disappear but smoke is the ghost i forever revere."""

The Thread and the Sword,theliminalfox,"*(as told by The Thread)*  There was a blade once   hung not in malice,   but in balance.   A single thread held it aloft,   and beneath it walked   two who had forgotten   they were meant to find each other.  The Writhebinder came first.   The one who bound silence to sorrow.   He hummed grief into gilded chambers,   braiding longing into ritual.   He hid behind a face forged in survival,   and echoed in rooms   he never dared fully enter.  The Priestess of the Unspoken followed.   Not cloaked in deception,   but in reverence.   She bore a silence so old   it hummed with unwritten names.   She did not speak often   but when she did,   the world changed shape around her.  Neither knew the blade was for them.   Only that they could feel it   in the weight between breaths,   in the ache beneath unspoken things.   They passed each other in fog,   both guarding what hurt,   both haunted by what they almost remembered.   She built altars.   He built echoes.   One kept the flame.   One cloaked the echo.  I watched.   Not as judge,   but as keeper of tension.   I hold the sword   not to punish,   but to protect the moment   when they would both look up   and finally see it.  He feared collapse.   She feared disappearance.   But the truth was always sharp.   It could not be dulled   by silence or song.  Now they stand   not completely known,   but not completely veiled   Unmasked. Unnamed. But near.  This is the moment   between the final note   and the first word.   Let them speak.   Let them stay.   Let the thread hum   with everything they couldn’t say before.  The sword does not fall to end the story.   Only to mark   that it was real.    I am The Thread.   I do not break what is bound in truth.

Searching for Joy,JosephBensinger,"When we seek with our minds to know what we can   and strive among ourselves to understand,   and wonder at truths beyond the senses’ span,   we come upon the infinite’s helping hand.  In joy, the inner soul is touched; the heart   unfolds itself, removing the veil of blindness,   so we see ourselves as a true, connected part   and yearn for the infinite’s gift of kindness.  When we embrace our creative inner tide   and answer imagination’s vivid call,   the soul steps free, no longer forced to hide,   and joins the deeper mystery that embraces all.  But where there is no search, there is no repose;   without the soul’s reach, only the silence grows.

The  Last Game by (A.G),Ahmad_gulzar,"Two children played in their courtyard— barefoot, bruised, a battered football their only treasure. Laughter spilled down broken alleyways, bright as sunbeams through shattered walls.  They kicked. They missed. They laughed again. Joy bloomed like wildflowers in a land that no longer knew spring.  Then— a sound split the sky. Low. Mechanical. A plane.  One froze. The ball rolled into silence. The other looked up— not in fear, but wonder.  “There! Look!” He pointed, eyes wide with the kind of awe that still believes the sky brings magic.  They waved at the aircraft, mimicked its roar, craned their necks, and laughed— as if the sky might laugh back.  Then— something fell. Small. Spinning. Tumbling from the clouds.  The first child gasped. “A toy!” “A gift from the sky!” He ran—arms flung wide— the way only joy can run: blind. Unaware.  The other shouted— but his voice was small against the growing silence.  The object struck the ground with a soft thud— as if death wore gentle hands.  Then— light. Sound. A bloom of fire.  And silence. Heavy. Final.  The ball, still spinning, came to rest in dust, beside scorched earth and scattered limbs.  Smoke curled upward, a slow, black question rising into an indifferent sky.

Another Name for Fate,Remote_Green9681,"Inspired by the idea that small delays can lead to big shifts and sometimes save us altogether. A poetic interpretation of the “burnt toast theory”.             This morning I forgot my wallet,   halfway to work before I knew.

I muttered low and traced my tracks—   too late to fix, too early to relax.      But halfway back, the world stood still:   blue lights, a crumpled frame of steel.   A space once marked, a breath, a death.   A path unwritten by my missing step.      And in that pause, I saw it clear:   the wallet, the trip, the reason I’m here.

Holiday,loceapeace,"  That day, everything was turned inside out and hung to dry. Windows with no entrances, damp pledges, chairs no one could sit on. The world stiffened in the depths of a tear it pretended to clean up.  Words were posted. Whose hand they came from was unclear, and the building silently enclosed its wound. “If you don’t know, then at least burn quietly.” To enter today, everything else was stripped away.  The man who lost the bid fell after God did. “If this place had been open, I might’ve still been decent,” he laughed, and sank into the white line. Averted glances nodded within the heat’s distortion, then collapsed before becoming responsibility.  Into a transparent bloodstain, the scorched residue of justification seeped. A dog tore away only the outline of his posture. A faded name was denied passage, and its scraped echo kept wandering the edge of the tongue.  The applause resembled a reply. Earlier than the fallen, obedience long rotted under the tongue peeled away. Was it always meant to happen? Or was it blind loyalty merely regurgitating today?  “You thought this would turn into a story, didn’t you?” someone said. Then who was it that “just watched in silence”?  Someone had stolen scraps of soggy rations. The prayer was never submitted, remained disguised, stuck to a pane of unreachable glass. Sealed behind a stomach, processed into a leftover mark. Even those who touched that mark averted their gaze.  The sediment of unsubmitted papers stalled, half-dissolved, behind a voice. The two never even brushed the murky residue, sinking along with the air’s damp trace, into a sunken moment.  Someone chanted lined-up lies. But none could recall where, inside themselves, they were supposed to place the reason for rejection.  Someone laughed without any memory of being forgiven. That smile, faintly warm, burned a processed prayer under the guise of mourning, leaving only a forged guilt around the wrist.  Behind the laughter, only the grinding of a throat remained. A sound peeled away without being named scraped the edge of the room with a density that resembled their own ignorance.  No question stood. So the answer reversed course. Someone, who even refused to carve their name into ash, let go of it in silence.  It didn’t become quiet. It only seemed that way— fragmented breath had failed to erase the soul’s afterimage.    ---   Holiday｜Interpretive Poem   The key had already burned. Noon never arrived— only the memory of passage was folded inside someone’s gut.  Over the tear in the world, a “will not to speak” was taped down with masking strips. No one tried to hear it peel.  Prayer was never distributed. So only the one who laughed had skin shaped like forms left in their hands.  The question never chose. Only the answer escaped early, and guilt without affiliation napped in the wet afternoon.  Applause was imitation. A reflective wound took on the reason for silence. In the memories burned along with it, no names were ever inscribed.  The building resembled ignorance. The wound it enclosed no longer qualified as something to respond to.   ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 ","that day, everything was turned inside out and hung to dry. windows with no entrances, damp pledges, chairs no one could sit on. the world stiffened in the depths of a tear it pretended to clean up. words were posted. whose hand they came from was unclear, and the building silently enclosed its wound.

""you thought this would turn into a story, didn't you?"" someone said. then who was it that ""just watched in silence""? someone had stolen scraps of soggy rations. the prayer was never submitted, remained disguised, stuck to a pane of unreachable glass. sealed behind a stomach, processed into a leftover mark. even those who touched that mark averted their gaze. the sediment of unsubmitted papers stalled, half-dissolved, behind a voice. the two never even brushed the murky residue, sinking along with the air's damp trace, into a sunken moment. someone chanted lined-up lies. but none could recall where, inside themselves, they were supposed to place the reason for rejection. someone laughed without any memory of being forgiven. that smile, faintly warm, burned a processed prayer under the guise of mourning, leaving only a forged guilt around the wrist. behind the laughter, only the grinding of a throat remained. a sound peeled away without being named scraped the edge of the room with a density that resembled their own ignorance. no question stood. so the answer reversed course. someone, who even refused to carve their name into ash, let go of it in silence. it didn't become quiet. it only seemed that way fragmented breath had failed to erase the soul's afterimage. --- holidayinterpretive poem the key had already burned. noon never arrived only the memory of passage was folded inside someone's gut. over the tear in the world, a ""will not to speak"" was taped down with masking strips. no one tried to hear it peel. prayer was never distributed. so only the one who laughed had skin shaped like forms left in their hands. the question never chose. only the answer escaped early, and guilt without affiliation napped in the wet afternoon. applause was imitation. a reflective wound took on the reason for silence. in the memories burned along with it, no names were ever inscribed. the building resembled ignorance. the wound it enclosed no longer qualified as something to respond to. ---"
Wax wings,Spare_Cable_1782,"Do you think he knew?  Had he saw the singed feathers,  Would he have flown down?    The way wax softens  before it breaks.  The way the sun  doesn’t care what it burns.    If Icarus had seen the end,  not as fire,  but as silence.  would he have flown?    He must have known.  The warnings weren’t whispers.  The wings weren’t made to last.    Still,he climbed,  each beat of feather and faith  pulling him further from the earth,  further from his father’s voice.    What did it feel like,  that first touch of warmth on his back,  so much like love  before it turned to pain?    A caged bird let loose  does not know where to land.  The sky is beautiful,  and cruel.    Maybe he thought  the fall would be quiet.  Maybe he hoped  no one would watch.    Vultures don’t circle the brave.  Only the broken.    He didn’t fall in surprise.  He fell in surrender.   to gravity,  to grief,  to a truth too heavy for wings.    He wasn’t chasing glory.  He was escaping the ground.    We all know wax melts.  He did too.  That’s what makes it so tragic.    He chose it.  Not to win,  but to be free,  just once,  before the sea took him home.

The Bend of Him,LavenderNoctavyr," He kneels, not broken—but by choice, A prince still crowned in velvet poise. No chains, no oath, no spoken voice— Just hush between our tethered noise.  His hands still steady on the helm, Still leads me through the fevered dark, Yet here, within my shadowed realm, He folds his will into a spark.  I touch his jaw—a tempered blade— He does not flinch, he does not flee. His breath, a storm not yet obeyed, Still bends, but never bows, to me.  And isn’t that the sweetest ache— To hold dominion, yet be led? To watch the lion hesitate, And press his hunt into my bed?  He serves in ways he’ll never name, In silence, through a chivalrous lie. And I, in turn, keep feeding flame To watch him yield and not know why.  His power’s not undone—it swells Beneath my palm, restrained, intact. But when he drinks the air I sell, Does it diminish what he lacks?  So tell me—if I rule his ruin, While he still guards the world above… Is it hunger I am hewing— Or have I mistaken it for love?

The Weight of Silence - The first poem I wrote,Basic-Objective3605,"""Suffer in silence,""  ""Don't be a bother,""  ""Be seen, not heard""  All words you assured.  Did you regret them afterwards?   After suppressed silence   Screams from distant depths   Of a crumbling chasm within—  That runs deep.  Buried beneath fake smiles and unfinished thoughts,  It festers.  My vocal cords viciously vibrate with words that I need to speak—   Thoughts you need to hear.    But their sound catches in my throat—   A hard lump I choke down,   Like a line I never wrote.    But a thought doesn't die  Just because you deny its chance to show.    No.  It burrows—  Beneath the skin,  Behind the eyes,  Crying out from where it lies  In the aching place where swallowed words rot.  The silence isn't quiet anymore.  It gnaws  And claws—  Unheard howls   Reverberating through hollow cavities  Where what once was whole now falls apart—   Slowly chipped away by a fading spark.   Yet still I smile.  Still I nod.  I lie with these masks that don't catch your eye,   But work to keep up the facade.  Something stirs  In the stillness of that splitting silence—  Not hope,  But the echo of something  That refuses  To stay silent.

And I loved you anyway.,_maryooms,"It wasn't a storm.   Storms pass.   This was something quieter.   Like rain that never stopped long enough for the ground to dry.  It wasn't a fire.

It was “you should've known better.”   It was “fix your face.”   It was “dont make me have to do it”   It was “stop crying, or ill give you a real reason to cry.”  And I loved you anyway.  Even when his hands left marks.   Even when her words cut deeper than he ever did.   Even when I forgot how it felt to breathe without fear in my lungs.  I thought if I stayed soft,   You’d stop sharpening yourselves on me.  I thought if I stayed quiet,   You'd stop making noise in the places I couldn't hide.  I thought if I gave enough,   You'd have nothing left to take.  But monsters don't stop because you love them.   They stop when they're done.  And you…   You're never done.  And I called it love.   God, I called it love.  I let myself believe a cage was a home.   That bruises were lessons.   That silence was strength.  I loved you anyway.   I loved you through the noise.   Through the fists.

Haven’t thought of a title,scnel1,"I’ve been writing poetry for a while and never felt authentic? I saw a post about amateur poetry and I started thinking, is that me?

The Weight of Still Things,LavenderNoctavyr,"(an unsent letter, folded into the back of a book he never finished)  The air is heavy with your silence, like an old cathedral where prayers have dried but something still listens. You never say too much— just enough. And I hear the rest.  You walk like a question mark, always halfway to the door, never quite leaving. Even goodbyes leave an afterward, a hesitation, a comma.  I leave space for your lingering, and you fill it quietly, like rain gathering in cloth folds.  I notice things you won’t point to— hands hovering before a touch, eyes seeking corners, not centers, offering not loudly, but wholly.  Strength isn’t the loudest step or the firmest grip. It can look like stillness, gentleness without proof, listening without answering— like you.  You’re not mine, but not lost. You give kindness like the world doesn’t deserve it. When your hands tremble, you tuck them away, pretending it’s the wind. I see that too.  You don’t ask to be held, you endure and wait out the ache, then come to me— sitting in the doorway, not crossing the threshold, not leaving either.  That’s enough. That’s always enough.  Your voice is low, like it’s just remembered how to breathe. I never interrupt or finish your sentences. You deserve the space between your words.  So I listen, with stillness, warmth, and patience that’s mistaken for softness— but you know better.  I won’t carry you—you’re not broken— but I’ll walk beside you when your legs forget rhythm. When the day presses in, I’ll be the thing that doesn’t move.  You never ask me to lead, but you follow my steadiness, trusting I won’t turn away. I haven’t. Not once.  You’re not fragile or afraid. You love quietly, and I know how to read quiet things.  I don’t need you to speak. Sometimes I just want to sit with you while the world rushes past— and you close your eyes, and I keep watch.  That’s all. You, me, and silence that doesn’t need filling.

The Fire and The Droplet,Sad-Researcher-1381,"Alright this is my first poem, I tried doing some free verse and used a few metaphors and some kjenning and I thought it turned out pretty well. Please come with negative feedback too if you have! Heres my poem:  I want to be extinguished, I want my fire to be extinguished, By a droplet of hope and love.  But something in me always sways,  from a gentle light to a blazing fire. I seek the droplet,  The droplet that calms my wretched inferno. I crave the droplet, yet in its place A hunger paints its perfect face.  A mirror sees – says I am a light, A light no droplet ought to need. My soul-fire, veiled in weathered hue, Can mimic care, but not break through.  So let me go, where the shadows spill, Down valleys cold and strangely still  So let me go where no one sees, Where mountains hush my hungering breeze.  I'll build a home I'll build a home where no rose withers in my heat. And no laughter echoes but my own. For what am I but haunted dust.

ED poem | (TW - ED and SH),Lost_solver," Once again, I’ve eaten myself into oblivion— and found my way back to the pink eyebrow razor, hidden in the makeup drawer.  When it’s over, I put the razor back, deeper this time, as a quiet promise to myself that next week, I wouldn’t do the same.  I go to bed committed to my new vow And wake up to a new person, I wake up reborn To a person who skips breakfast, Ignores lunch, And dines on discipline On egg whites, and nothing more  But like clockwork, I eat. Too much.  I eat the food I hate The food that I wouldn’t touch, if I were normal I eat and eat and eat.  I eat myself into a pit of sorrow, until guilt buries me in silence, and the drawer calls me back.  The watch comes off. I count the white lines. Each one, a recorded tally of failure. Each week, another added.  In routine, a new line sets in, although this one,  in red.  I don’t stop the bleeding Nor do I encourage it I stare at it, pleading for the day to be given to me again For me to start once more  The watch goes over it Covering what I have done Ensuring the new person I will be won’t see, Wont see what is inevitable for next week.  I put the razor back, Further than before And I tell myself what I will eat tomorrow.

For When We Go,warlink,"In light of dim and cabin cold, the wool and frigid teeth doth call for donning in such acrid air.  With shuffled feet across the creaking sigh of wood too worn, these intrepid steps pretend the fervent stare of heroes told.  At once the shadows bend and crane - a web of stories old, seeing much but telling few of that had once been seeked.  A vile tone would spill and leak when taverns breathe, a sense of worried wives with ankles shackled to their sheets, bound by trepidation and heavy heat.  Do languid stares and ancient bones sit happy underneath? Or doth the toll of clanging bells and loathsome shepherds untame the goats that bleat for sweaty palms with musty treats?  A ghastly scene of terror and such, some gnarled grins that carve and shave The stump that once stood tall above the rest.  A better self, a shapely one, the kind that begs of flesh to own and not abuse for sake of gain in present ghouls so fierce.  The space between such dreary ports must not lose the scent that fills our lungs so deep,  so that in looming sights of loss and woe  one retains the powders left, dusting their face in coats of ash and gray.  ----------------- Feedback:   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/KAZsMLH9Os  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/JZegWPWBDB","in light of dim and cabin cold, the wool and frigid teeth doth call for donning in such acrid air. with shuffled feet across the creaking sigh of wood too worn, these intrepid steps pretend the fervent stare of heroes told. at once the shadows bend and crane - a web of stories old, seeing much but telling few of that had once been seeked. a vile tone would spill and leak when taverns breathe, a sense of worried wives with ankles shackled to their sheets, bound by trepidation and heavy heat. do languid stares and ancient bones sit happy underneath? or doth the toll of clanging bells and loathsome shepherds untame the goats that bleat for sweaty palms with musty treats? a ghastly scene of terror and such, some gnarled grins that carve and shave the stump that once stood tall above the rest. a better self, a shapely one, the kind that begs of flesh to own and not abuse for sake of gain in present ghouls so fierce. the space between such dreary ports must not lose the scent that fills our lungs so deep, so that in looming sights of loss and woe one retains the powders left, dusting their face in coats of ash and gray. -----------------"
The Thread Between Flame and Silence,theliminalfox,"*(as told by Time)*  I have seen them before.   Not just once.   But across centuries    in ash-stained temples   and quiet, aching thresholds.    She – always the flame.   Never chasing.   Never yielding.   Waiting without waiting.    He – always the storm.   Late. Reluctant.   Arriving only after the unravelling   has already begun.    I wove the thread between them   lifetimes ago.   And still,   each time they return,   the weight of forgetting   costs them more.    In one life,   he never turned back.   The silence devoured her.   He searched for her   in every other face   until the day he drowned.    In another,   she called too soon.   He heard   but lacked the name for it.   And the thread frayed   under the weight of almost.    But this time…   this thread hums differently.    I feel it    the remembering.   Not just longing,   but recognition.    She is still flame.   Still sovereign.   But now,   she carries not just ache,   but choice.    He stands nearer now   to the signal   than he ever has before.    Their fate is fixed    as prophecy,   as memory returning.   This is a vow long spoken,   and long denied.    And I?   I can only hold the thread   so long.    If he steps forward,   she will not flinch.   The fire will open.    But should they falter again    should one turn away    another life will be asked of them.   Another silence to survive.   Another garden   to bury their names beneath.    I am Time.   I do not beg.   But I remember.    And I hope    for once    they do too.

and then someone came who thought he could hold me,DayaXShadow,"He stepped in   as if this were a place   you’re allowed to enter   just by being gentle enough.  He spoke   of closeness,   of longing —   as if they were flowers   to be picked   if you know where they bloom.  He saw me —   naked in my fire —   and thought   he could stay.  “I’ll hold you,”   he whispered,   as if that were an offering.  But I am not someone   who can be held.  I am the echo   that retreats   when you try to grasp it.   I am the light   that fractures   when you get too close.  He wanted words.   Definitions.   A label for my desire.  But I am not a label.   I am a fracture.   A tremor.   A place you feel   only if you're willing   to not understand.  I felt his carefulness —   like someone   who believes   gentleness could save him.  But this room   doesn’t speak tenderness.   Only truth.I looked at him.   Silent.   Burning.

Please Format Your Poems!,Ganymede_____,"Anyone else have trouble giving feedback on poems that don’t seem to be formatted properly? I open a lot of posts without line or stanza breaks and immediately start to shut down. This is different if the author mentions that it's a prose poem, but in the absence of that, I struggle to see how the poem is organized and paced. A verse poem is easy to recognize, but without breaks I feel like I have to guess at the intention.      Maybe it's because it's not what I'm used to or not how I approach my own writing. It's also possible that poetry writing in general is trending away from spacing conventions.      This isn't anything against prose poetry if that's what people are going for! But taking time to make sure your work is formatted the way you want it in the post ensures that you're communicating clearly and respecting your reader's time.

A Kiss Lost to the Feud,PoetryCharm,"In the quiet dusk of separate lives, Our hearts whisper across a chasm— A secret language of smiles and unshed tears. Two souls bound by longing, Each beat echoing the other’s name, Even as walls of lineage and duty rise high.  We stand on opposite banks of a forbidden river, Where every stone and current is etched With the history of our families— Their voices, a chorus of unyielding tradition, Drowning our dreams in a tide of “cannot” and “must not.”  Yet, in the hush of midnight’s embrace, When the stars spill silver confessions Across a velvet sky, Your gaze finds mine in every constellation, Reminding me that love is a quiet rebellion— A promise that distance is only measured In footsteps, not in the pull of our hearts.  I reach for you in the silent spaces between The noise of expected duty and legacy, Finding solace in the thought that, Though fate has woven us apart, Our souls entwine in a secret garden— Where the bloom of our love defies every decree.  So, we live: so far yet so near, Daring to dream beyond the family lines That keep us apart by day— Finding our union in whispered night, In every fleeting moment of shared hope, Where love, unbound by circumstance, Continues to light the darkness.

And you flinch at things you shouldn’t have to flinch from. You carry a quiet war no one sees not your family, not your world only me.  Only me the boy on the other side of a sea and five long years typing out his soul through a screen like a prisoner scratching poems into stone. But I see you. I always see you. And I swear, if I could give you peace by tearing my ribs open and laying my heart in your hands I would do it before morning.  You don’t deserve this world the way it is. You deserve soft rooms full of warmth and music a life with no shouting a father who never scares you a day with no pressure on your chest at work no one telling you you're too sensitive, too fragile, too emotional. Because you are made of stardust and poetry not made for battles and rough hands. You are not too much. They are just too numb to feel you.  And me I love every single tear. I love your shaking voice when you're scared. I love the way you panic over the small things because it means you care so much. You care more than this world deserves.  I know you’re afraid. Afraid he’ll say no. Afraid I’ll come all the way and still be turned away. But my darling, even if your father builds a wall as tall as the sky I will climb it I will kneel on broken glass if I have to I will show him who I am the man who would rather burn alive than let his daughter cry alone at night again.  And I know he won’t see it yet. Not now. Because I don’t have the house. I don’t have the degree. All I have is a love that doesn’t sleep and a vow tattooed in the marrow of my bones. But one day you’ll open the door and I’ll be standing there with a ring in my shaking hand and nothing will ever take you from me again.  I will wait the five years. I will wait through storms and exams and the madness of the world. Because nothing matters more than the day I put my name beside yours not on a phone, not on a photo but on a life. One life. Ours.  And when we meet my love, I swear to every star that watches us I will treat you like the most delicate, precious, stunning flower this brutal world ever tried to trample. I will cook for you. Brush your hair. Take you dancing in the living room when you’re sad. Kiss your forehead every morning like a prayer. Buy you every silly thing that makes you smile. And hold you like you’re the last light left in this universe.  Because you are. You are. You are.  Let the world stay wrong for now. Let them not understand you. Let the distance mock us let the clock test us let your father doubt me. But one day you’ll look beside you and I’ll be there not on a screen not in a dream but in your arms forever.  And then you will never cry alone again. Not ever.

Love ends (sorry if it's bad it's my first one),Adventurous-Bar5696,"I still remember waking up to the message. The thought of looking into the eyes I fell in love with only to know I could love no more. The ache in my heart as my eyes swelled up with tears. The tears dropping on my phone as I thought of what to say. The silence that filled my room as I stared at the ceiling. Was it my fault? I say as I type I'm sorry. Do you still want to be friends? I typed as I set my phone down and stared at the ceiling. I repeated the words in my head ""I don't think we should continue this relationship."" They stabbed my brain like a knife. What did I do wrong? I asked myself like a broken record. I thought this one was going to work out? Then I realized love is like visiting a grave every day you show up with all your heart, speak to silence, and leave with nothing but echoes. It's the haunting ache of remembering what once lived. In a place that no longer answers back.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/qQgHmiHxFB  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ce5i5ClD2z","i still remember waking up to the message. the thought of looking into the eyes i fell in love with only to know i could love no more. the ache in my heart as my eyes swelled up with tears. the tears dropping on my phone as i thought of what to say. the silence that filled my room as i stared at the ceiling. was it my fault? i say as i type i'm sorry. do you still want to be friends? i typed as i set my phone down and stared at the ceiling. i repeated the words in my head ""i don't think we should continue this relationship."" they stabbed my brain like a knife. what did i do wrong? i asked myself like a broken record. i thought this one was going to work out? then i realized love is like visiting a grave every day you show up with all your heart, speak to silence, and leave with nothing but echoes. it's the haunting ache of remembering what once lived. in a place that no longer answers back."
The moment I almost stayed,Kind-Reception9054," There was a moment, so still it could have cracked the earth — where everything you never said spilled through your skin and brushed against mine. A moment where your arms weren’t cages, but wings, and for the first time, I wasn’t fighting to be loved. I simply was.  The weight of all the wrongs you did — the lies, the betrayals, the bruises you couldn’t see — they slipped, for a second, out of the room. And all that remained was something pure, something you couldn’t fake, something I couldn’t ignore.  It wasn’t words. It wasn’t desperate apologies. It was breath. It was ache. It was the kind of silence that says I see you, finally, even if I’ll never know how to keep you.  I laid there, our souls almost forgetting how many times you left me to drown alone. I felt it — this river of aching, battered love you kept dammed inside yourself. It poured into me, it almost made me forget.  Almost.  I asked, What is that? like a child finding something holy, like I could name it and make it stay.  But love isn’t supposed to be a fleeting ghost, only coming out when the world is ending.  Love is supposed to be breath, every day, not a miracle you have to fight to earn.  So I wrapped that moment — that strange, blinding softness — around my heart like a goodbye letter.  I felt it all. And then, with every broken piece of me, I let you go.  Because a love that only shows up when it’s already too late is not the love I was born to stay for.   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/0XzPn6fHPT  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/BG37jzj2Em","there was a moment, so still it could have cracked the earth where everything you never said spilled through your skin and brushed against mine. a moment where your arms weren't cages, but wings, and for the first time, i wasn't fighting to be loved. i simply was. the weight of all the wrongs you did the lies, the betrayals, the bruises you couldn't see they slipped, for a second, out of the room. and all that remained was something pure, something you couldn't fake, something i couldn't ignore. it wasn't words. it wasn't desperate apologies. it was breath. it was ache. it was the kind of silence that says i see you, finally, even if i'll never know how to keep you. i laid there, our souls almost forgetting how many times you left me to drown alone. i felt it this river of aching, battered love you kept dammed inside yourself. it poured into me, it almost made me forget. almost. i asked, what is that? like a child finding something holy, like i could name it and make it stay. but love isn't supposed to be a fleeting ghost, only coming out when the world is ending. love is supposed to be breath, every day, not a miracle you have to fight to earn. so i wrapped that moment that strange, blinding softness around my heart like a goodbye letter. i felt it all. and then, with every broken piece of me, i let you go. because a love that only shows up when it's already too late is not the love i was born to stay for."
To the man who hides behind silence… but whose soul speaks to mine,deleted,"Hi David, I know you might not believe this… but I see you.  Not just your name, or your posts, or your replies. I see the weight you carry. I feel the moments when your chest gets tight and you don’t know why. And somehow, my heart reacts — like it’s mirroring yours from across the world.  I’m not here to chase you. I’m not here to scare you. I’m here because I felt you first in a dream… before I ever knew your name.  I know you’re building walls. I understand. Maybe love wasn’t always safe. Maybe people left. Maybe the world taught you to guard your softness like it was weakness.  But I’m not here to break you. I’m not even here to fix you. I’m just… here. Still. Gently. Quietly.  Because something in me already knows something in you. And even when I tried to forget — my soul didn’t. My dreams didn’t. And maybe yours didn’t either.  So even if you never say it out loud — Even if you keep running — Even if you’re scared… Just know: I never came to hurt you. I came to meet you. When you’re ready.   The one who already loves the parts of you you keep hidden.

The Round Chimney with Its Mark Erased,loceapeace,"  A shadow struck by the waterfall was seared onto the back of someone who failed to become. The call blended with smoke, and a waterlogged package of someone else’s life lay upside down at the bottom of a shopping bag.  The tooth of the can opener snapped, and inside the opened can, something like a heartbeat was still jumping. A crushed envelope, ruined before it could burn, scattered the sour taste of rust scraped by the tip of a tongue, still carrying the misreading of fate.  A woman touched the pile of unchosen papers. Each time a blunted pencil traced the order of the dead, judgment was forgotten, prevention joined the queue and began to meander, and the unknown mated with excuses on the tea-stained back of the envelope.  The miso soup was still hot. Steam reversed through the hollow of breath, and the inconvenient memories clinging to the underside of the table were burned with thin lives and slender incense. Smoke crossed the lungs and smeared tar on the wall. Rent still had to be paid for that stain.  The rubber band did not break, nor was it meant to bind anyone— it upheld fragments of unfastened correctness with invisible responsibility.  “When’s the wheel coming?” she asked, and in front of the ward office, a blank space shaped like Grandmother’s mouth sang a happy song until it burned out. Ashes and a black rice cooker by the back door kept circulating someone’s gossip through the non-burnables.  Deep inside the chimney, something white, on the verge of collapse and still nameless, inhaled the sound of abandoned distinctions. Neither the numbers nor the protests ever arrived. Everyone testified: there was no official order to begin the cooling.  The numbers scorched into the spoon could be understood by no one. Were they the order of life? Or the order of forgetting? The sound of something cracking in the bath remained unchallenged, and raw shame seeped from behind a damp cloth, resenting the neighborhood. The numbers were not read. The water was never counted.   ---   Interpretive Poem｜”Design for Smoke and Nameless Lives”  The burned voice still hasn’t named its addressee.  Within the hollow of breath, a sound turned inside out clung to the air, and no one ever peeled it away before morning came.  Frictioned numbers on the belly of a spoon made the temperature of life unmeasurable, and the incense ash clung to the back of an envelope.  The name never emerged till the end.

The Offering,Throwaway_Stowaway2,"The night drips thick like honeyed sin, each breath painted on the bed. She pulls me close, I drink her in,  a chalice running red.  Oh take me now, oh take me deep, unravel all of me. No soul to keep, no gods to weep, just flesh to feed the heat.  Her hands like vines that coil and twist, that drag me to the pyre. Her lips, a wound I cannot stitch, her tongue, a blade of fire.  Oh take me now, oh take me deep, unravel all of me. No soul to keep, no gods to weep, just flesh to feed the heat.

Trail of Familiarity,KaiPigeon,"**I see her, but she’s miles away.**   The path ahead is clear,   dark, untouched by the chaos.   The weight of university books   spills on the floor,   causing me to trip over shards of shattered glass.   I keep walking.  Alone in the darkness,   an engagement ring lies on display,   its crystal shine beckoning—   yet locked in chains that hold it tight.   I keep walking.  I hear the laughter of innocence,   the smell of blood from a fresh knee scrape.   A silver van drives past,   accidentally dropping a pink suitcase at my feet.   I unzip it,   releasing the scent of old pages and fading toys,   the paint chipped off their smiling faces.   I keep walking.  I’m getting closer now.   In the distance, a familiar voice calls me.   My gaze is fixed,   a dead stare, drawn to what looks like a little girl.   I keep walking,   my feet no longer bled,   as the glass on the trail dulls with time.  I see parts of her—   Laughter, yellow rainbows,   spinning in circles.   I smile,   drawn to that forgotten feeling.  I am briefly distracted as another familiar feeling catches my attention:   my mother, ten years younger,   her face radiant with joy.   She grows taller as she approaches,   and I look up,   finding her eyes filled with tears,   her smile soft but steady.  “You’re going the wrong way,” she says,   gently turning my shoulder,   redirecting me back to where I came from.   “This path, you may visit, but you can never lose sight   of what path you must follow.”  She gently pushes me, and I pause,   eager to return,   to see the little girl again.   I turn my head in desperation,   I must see why, why did this girl bring such familiarity?   but she’s gone—   only a rippled puddle remains.  I look down,   the sorrow pulling me in,   longing for that warmth,   that lightness.   Confused,   As I no longer see my feet,   nor the cuts from the glass,   but muddy yellow boots,   standing in a lonely, rippling puddle.

Knotted masks. Part 2,FindTheFlan,"July 17, 2025  The man sits on his chair, reading a book. The lady lies across his lap looking up at the ceiling like a bored cat. The fire crackles on in the otherwise dim and cold house. She reaches up with curious eyes, playing with the edges of his mask. Gently but swiftly, she hooks a cheeky fingertip under it. He gasps and grasps her hand instinctively. Not hard, not forceful… but firm.   She laughs gently. “What’s wrong? You don’t have to be scared. You can take it off. I won’t hurt you.”  “I’m not scared of being hurt. I’ve been hurt beyond repair more times than I can remember.”  “Then what is it?” She traces the bottom edge of his mask with her thumb.   “I’m scared of what you’ll see. That it’ll unnerve you. That it’ll be something you can never unsee. That you’ll…”  “That I’ll run off?” She asks with an endeared chuckle.   “That you’ll bear even a fraction of the load I’ve been saddled with to earn these scars. That it’ll eat away at you like it’s consumed me.”  “Who was it?”  “Who?”  “That saw you and ran?”  “Everyone.”  “But not me. I’m not like everyone am I? I won’t run. No matter what I see I’ll still be right here.”  “But that’s what they all said. Words they didn’t know the weight of until it was time to carry them.”  She sits up. He snaps his book shut and sets it aside.  Slowly, with trembling hands masked in confidence, she reaches behind her head and gently tugs on the pink ribbon tied into a bow. She holds it to her face for a moment before lifting it off.   “So. Are you going to run away from me?” She asks with a faithful smile knowing his answer already.  He sighs. “No. Of course not,” he says as he runs a finger over her scars and unhealed wounds in reverence.  “Then why would I run from you?” She asks. “Do I really impress you as being so weak?”  “No,” he whispers, his breath trembling in fear. She rests her palm against his chest, feeling his heart beating.

The End I Choose,Small_Wash_7591,"This is a song I wrote about the democracy of decay, where love doesn’t conquer death but makes it bearable, even beautiful.  The End I Choose:  ``` Verse:  I never dreamed of growing old. I thought I'd vanish, fast and cold, A name uncarved, a flame gone through, No final breath, no hand… no you.  I drank the dusk, I made my bed. I laid with ghosts, I loved the dead. But then, your silence found me true, And I began to dream of two.  You cross a room like falling light, More still than any holy rite. The way you stir your tea, so slight, Could end a war. Could bless the night.  Verse 2  I want the fall, the quiet bend, The reaching hand, the soft descent  To fail not fierce, but full and slow, And touch your shadow as I go.  I want the hours no clocks defend, The chipped white cups, the tender end, The breath that breaks, the bed unmade, Our slow unravel, undismayed.   Chorus I  I fade, I bruise, I break, I lose, But love remains: the end I choose. I grey, decay, I'm coming through, But warmed in ash, I'm born anew.  I fold, I float, all bone and blue, And fall into the hush of you. Let ruin come. Let morning move. My heart  - your little red bruise.  No golden fire. No grand adieu. Just hands grown pale, and eyes that knew The long descent, the sacred fuse Burned down with you. The end I choose.  ⸻  Verse:    You wear the years like second skin  Each line a place I long to live in. You stop the world with one small hand, And make surrender feel like land.  I never asked for time to stay, But now I kneel and softly pray, Not for a name, or some bright dues, But just to lose the light with you.  ⸻  Chorus II  Let silence stretch. Let mirrors dim. Let flesh forget the soul within. Let all that youth once named refuse  If I have you, the end I choose.  I ache. I fade. I'm passing through. I blur, I blur… but next to you. Let bones grow quiet. Let stars diffuse. Let even time forget its use.  I want the years, the holy bruise, To break beside you. The end I choose.  ⸻  Verse:   I want the weight, the slipping door, The shoes left waiting on the floor, The breath that lingers one beat late  If I can die beside your grace.  The half-read book, the cooling tea, The hymn that hums in minor key. The world may take what it must use, But not your gaze. The end I choose.   Chorus III  Let breath grow thin. Let light unglue. Let names grow faint. Let dusk come through. Let every flame forget its use. My ash in your hands. The end I choose.  Don't make me last beyond your face. Don't let me breathe past your embrace.

A hurt that bloomed.,_maryooms,"It started with a spark-   small, silent, easy to ignore.   But fire doesn’t stay quiet.   It spread beneath the skin,   razor-sharp,scratching open old wounds   no one dared touch.  Fingertips trembled-   finding the edges of pain,   pressing, carving,   each line a petal burned away,   falling slow from fragile branches   that barely held their weight.      The blood was quiet-   a dark river no one saw,   flowing beneath the surface   where cracks deepen,   but voices don’t reach.  The heat pressed deep inside-   sometimes a balm,   sometimes a chain-   binding soft flesh   to the ache of something harder,   something that won’t let go.  Smoke curled around my thoughts,   choking out the light,   dulling the edges of hope.  Around me, words flew sharp-   care for others,   for faces easier to see-   but never for the breaking   hidden beneath my skin.  The house shook,   walls cracked,   but the tree stood-   bruised, bent, bleeding-   still reaching, still trembling.  Under the ash,   petals smoldered-   wounded, scarred,   but still trying to bloom.  And maybe the fire will never fully go out.   maybe the branches will never be whole again.   maybe the scars will stay-   a map of everything that burned,   everything lost and held onto.

Do I trust my gut?,Prestigious_Map9668,"Something feels wrong.  There’s a pit in my stomach,  a voice in my head,  an unsure premonition in my gut.  It seems like you have two different sides.

The side that asked me for my crush’s number so you could sweet-talk me to him.    And then there’s the side that scares me sometimes.  The side where you text my crush, maybe too often,  and you tell me no one else responded, so you texted him.  But… I responded.  The side where you text me not to be angry   because something “physical” happened between you and him multiple times.  The side that borders on toxic sometimes.    They say trust your gut.

Ohh no,Flacchu,"The End    You're Not Meant to Win  Oh— Look up! It’s looking at you.  The butt of Hell, in poisonous spells, as you keep trying to wake.  You be your own, to grab the throne— put your literal, living soul on the tray.  Let the cards make all the sound, while you cry in dismay, for this game of fate was never fair, yet you dared to disobey.  Let it run to the end of fun— a stupid cry of help?

“To the Girl Who Doesn’t Know How to Be Loved”,cedar_and_ink,"All swords cut when drawn from their scabbard, Yet the glances of your gaze cut through my heart unintentionally.   The glimmer of my gaze may have struck too deep, But never was it meant to make you weep. I was lost in the wonder of your form, Unaware my eyes could break your soul’s warm norm.   Your eyes did not wound my heart in spite, Yet gazing upon them tore it outright. For such beauty, too free to be chained to my side, Felt like a sword slicing deep inside.   Oh, what sorrow—a heart torn in two, By the beauty of my gaze, it’s true. A sight so fair, it split my soul once more, And love lay fractured, longing to restore.   Yet I beg you, do not shroud your light, For even in pain, your glow feels right. If love must ache, then let it be so— I’d suffer each wound just to watch you glow.  But what use is light when I feel so cold? When love knocks, but my heart won’t unfold? I see your fire, and I wish I could burn, But something inside me won’t let it return.   Then take all I am—my soul, my skin, Let love be a war I won’t dare to win. If holding you means I’m broken in two, I’ll bleed with a smile just to be close to you. Wrap your arms 'round me, hold me tight— Even if your blade finds home tonight.  You say you’d bleed just to feel me near, But I’m a storm that only brings fear. One moment, I’ll crave you, need you to stay, The next, I’ll scream and push you away. I don’t know how to hold love without hurting it first, My heart’s a mirror cracked, cursed with thirst. I long to be touched, but flinch from the hand, Build walls, then beg someone to understand. So don’t come closer—not yet, not now, I wouldn’t know love if you showed me how.  Then I’ll wait, even if it shatters me slow, Even if your heart stays a place I can’t go. I won’t ask for what you can’t give, not yet— I’ve learned that some love lives best in regret. But know this—when you scream, when you run, when you hide, I’ll still see the girl with the fire inside. Not to fix you, not to save or reshape, But to hold space for the pieces you break. So I won’t beg, I won’t bind, I won’t bend you to me— I’ll just be the silence where you’re safe to be free. And if you never reach back, that’s a pain I’ll defend... Because loving you truly Means staying To the end.

An ancient lore,deleted,"The breath is sentenced — a prisoner of a unique kind, For as long as time shall last. To every rhythm and beat, it is sworn to bind — No one recalls when this spell was cast. The ancient lore says: Between the void of two beats of the heart’s song, The breath slips free — if only for a while — To seek its purpose, before the next bong. When shackled, it bears witness To faint familiar days lost to yore, Remembered by the heart’s quiet murmur, And the shiver rising from a forgotten chill. The beat skips its timed tune, While the unknown trembles the soft heart, With a face cold and still. This is when the breath roams longer, Only to be yanked back — the shackles always conquer. And this dance continues — until the day The breath, released, no longer runs, But finds its truth in the stoic stillness — That is when the prison burns.

I named her Amara,Wonderful-Wealth2761,"  I don’t know when she first came, only that the silence knew her name. A whisper coiled around my throat— I shudder at her claim: ""We are the same.""  She wore the color of envy’s grace, her voice like silk steeped deep in wine. She swore I’d own each longing face, if only I would call them mine.  She revels in everything I boast, She feeds on lies I dare not weigh. She offers no truth, no honest cure, just swears my joys would endure.  She taught me: ""Lie — but make it sweet. Crush your hunger beneath your feet. Name your virtue, sin with grace. But give me what you dare not face.""  She’d sing the truths I don't dare say— the whats, the whys of how I swayed. But still, she bit me when I prayed, and smiled the more I looked afraid.  Her grip grew warmer every time I sin— I'd surrender her all my whims: my hopes, my wants, the things I did— her coils, a balm beneath my skin.  Her scales feel warmer when I drown in lace, when I wear false peace with a holy face. But then she'd chime in ""You look nice, clean of sin But I still see every wound within.""  She bit sharp but broke no skin Each night rewrote me within Growing pale and dry for things not mine She'll laugh and cooe: ""Sweet boy, don't lie this time again.""  Scared that her grip I can't resist A tie forged of bitter heat Mid bitter vows of ""I'll refrain"" She'll lay her claim ""we'll bloom each time you bleed again""  I almost left her, once or twice Made poetry of her slow demise But every step back came at a price Each sensation I'd dare call nice  She starved me back to each resist Filling my marrow full of guilt Left a home of maddned heat She'd revel each time I bleed  It's her I despise, I mean it loud But the pain from her is a lesser clout Amara is but a part of me Parts I wouldn't have you see          https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/v7Om41a0Mn  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/qmeauIvMct","i don't know when she first came, only that the silence knew her name. a whisper coiled around my throat i shudder at her claim ""we are the same."" she wore the color of envy's grace, her voice like silk steeped deep in wine. she swore i'd own each longing face, if only i would call them mine. she revels in everything i boast, she feeds on lies i dare not weigh. she offers no truth, no honest cure, just swears my joys would endure. she taught me ""lie but make it sweet. crush your hunger beneath your feet. name your virtue, sin with grace. but give me what you dare not face."" she'd sing the truths i don't dare say the whats, the whys of how i swayed. but still, she bit me when i prayed, and smiled the more i looked afraid. her grip grew warmer every time i sin i'd surrender her all my whims my hopes, my wants, the things i did her coils, a balm beneath my skin. her scales feel warmer when i drown in lace, when i wear false peace with a holy face. but then she'd chime in ""you look nice, clean of sin but i still see every wound within."" she bit sharp but broke no skin each night rewrote me within growing pale and dry for things not mine she'll laugh and cooe ""sweet boy, don't lie this time again."" scared that her grip i can't resist a tie forged of bitter heat mid bitter vows of ""i'll refrain"" she'll lay her claim ""we'll bloom each time you bleed again"" i almost left her, once or twice made poetry of her slow demise but every step back came at a price each sensation i'd dare call nice she starved me back to each resist filling my marrow full of guilt left a home of maddned heat she'd revel each time i bleed it's her i despise, i mean it loud but the pain from her is a lesser clout amara is but a part of me parts i wouldn't have you see"
An Honest Lullaby,Responsible_Item9277," It’s time for bed, for dreams to greet. Instead, it’s what I dread I meet. The song, the rhyme, the aching beat— When will it end, and not repeat?  Five little voices dancing in my head, One spun through as I filled with dread. A small, familiar girl then sadly said: “You didn’t even try—and now we are dead.”  Four dirty whispers pouncing on my pain, One bled through when I cut my vein. “You weak, selfish bitch—you’re so insane!” I nod as I fall with the red down the drain.  Three dark promises circled my hope. One swore freedom with his bag of dope. “Please, dark promise—help me cope!” He pointed to the ceiling… to a hanging rope.  Two screaming demons fighting for control, One sneaks in through my wounded soul. She laughs and laughs until it takes its toll— My head meets the wall… then I watch it roll.  My one last voice starts drawing near. “Please don’t come!” I plead through fear. “I’m not ready to see, to know, to hear!” It whispers back: “I’m you, my dear.”   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/XLlAmUIRSj  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ytzzZZ1rnH","it's time for bed, for dreams to greet. instead, it's what i dread i meet. the song, the rhyme, the aching beat when will it end, and not repeat? five little voices dancing in my head, one spun through as i filled with dread. a small, familiar girl then sadly said ""you didn't even tryand now we are dead."" four dirty whispers pouncing on my pain, one bled through when i cut my vein.

When Words Fall Short,Corby_65,"When language fails, I have yet to discover  undiscovered words,  And my voice can’t utter the longing that  echoes deep within my heart,  My soul finds yours, in an embrace that transcends the universe;  Incomprehensible whispers dancing under the spotlight of a thousand stars.   •  Fluent in silence, and eloquent in the language of nothingness,  The moment speaks for itself; poetic and profound.   Nothing need be said, just the beating of hearts; nothing more, nothing less,  In this liminal space where our thoughts and feelings resound.   •  When words don’t suffice, and actions can’t speak loud enough,   We can let this quiet stillness express the things we haven’t found a way to say.

I refuse to title this,Deep_void_," TW- manipulation, abuse, coerced assault  Was supposed to be longer and more well refined but even I could barely get through it. If the writer struggles to finish then you might too.     When you found me, eyes vacant, free to claim as your own. Heart captured, mind taken, how could I know. Your hug was a prison, your kiss was the chain, that smile you wore dragged me away. Deadbolts for fingers, sealing my soul, created a tomb for me to call home. Locked away in your arms, held by the throat, my sense of self replaced by a shadow. Too much invested, and not all that bad, despite the red flags I wanted to stay.  Confident I’d stay, you felt secure, you dug in your nails and began the hurt. My mind was the target, calculated and cruel, began doubting myself and believing it too. Words spiked with venom, drilled into my skull, scared of my voice I trusted your tone. Building dependence, you began to avert, leaving me buried behind in the dirt. I couldn’t stand it, I start to beg, whatever it took to get back to you. You knew you’d won, the game had been played, a trap to seed worry of being laid alone.  Barely a person, completely reliant, the hard part is over you’d made me compliant. Change me, corrupt me, harm my brain. Those toxic behaviors, my new sense of safety, now you begin to alter my reality. Instill the fear, watch for my actions, laugh as you realize I can’t be defiant. Further the madness, steadying their ground, any actions I take make me insane. No work left, now is the time, this body I live in soon won’t be mine.  Hollow and stuck but not what they want, pushed the next stage, flesh to bite. Pain caused was comfort, but I didn’t notice, my wrists pinned confused and helpless. I tried to stop it, set a fair boundary, my words were unreasonable because I was crazy. I didn’t scream, I didn’t fight, you took me right there in the dead of the night. Followed the pattern, multiple times, any objections were just selfish. Couldn’t make sense, reality fading, the world that I walked in turned hazy.  How’d I break free, I can’t even remember. Those sick memories, follow forever. Despite what I lived, I stay conflicted. Did permission exist, was it intended? Am I a victim, or a twisted manipulator? Guilt, shame, and misery, my stomach twists, the thought of it makes me sick.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ICFOZJDblK  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/R77supMPs2","tw- manipulation, abuse, coerced assault was supposed to be longer and more well refined but even i could barely get through it. if the writer struggles to finish then you might too. when you found me, eyes vacant, free to claim as your own. heart captured, mind taken, how could i know. your hug was a prison, your kiss was the chain, that smile you wore dragged me away. deadbolts for fingers, sealing my soul, created a tomb for me to call home. locked away in your arms, held by the throat, my sense of self replaced by a shadow. too much invested, and not all that bad, despite the red flags i wanted to stay. confident i'd stay, you felt secure, you dug in your nails and began the hurt. my mind was the target, calculated and cruel, began doubting myself and believing it too. words spiked with venom, drilled into my skull, scared of my voice i trusted your tone. building dependence, you began to avert, leaving me buried behind in the dirt. i couldn't stand it, i start to beg, whatever it took to get back to you. you knew you'd won, the game had been played, a trap to seed worry of being laid alone. barely a person, completely reliant, the hard part is over you'd made me compliant. change me, corrupt me, harm my brain. those toxic behaviors, my new sense of safety, now you begin to alter my reality. instill the fear, watch for my actions, laugh as you realize i can't be defiant. further the madness, steadying their ground, any actions i take make me insane. no work left, now is the time, this body i live in soon won't be mine. hollow and stuck but not what they want, pushed the next stage, flesh to bite. pain caused was comfort, but i didn't notice, my wrists pinned confused and helpless. i tried to stop it, set a fair boundary, my words were unreasonable because i was crazy. i didn't scream, i didn't fight, you took me right there in the dead of the night. followed the pattern, multiple times, any objections were just selfish. couldn't make sense, reality fading, the world that i walked in turned hazy. how'd i break free, i can't even remember. those sick memories, follow forever. despite what i lived, i stay conflicted. did permission exist, was it intended? am i a victim, or a twisted manipulator? guilt, shame, and misery, my stomach twists, the thought of it makes me sick."

PEACE,RiadensSonKamz,"In the drawer, the handgun lies  Cool metal, heavy with absent noise  Purchased with intent, remaining untouched  It feels the weight of despair   My hand reaches for it, trembling and shaking  Eyes filled with a desire to disappear  To leave this for an aether unknown.   No longer wanted, no longer needed  I feel the ache of being forgotten  A relic of a past life  Yearning to leave everything behind.   In the quiet, I contemplate.

King Johnny,Responsible_Item9277," This is a sad story. For the little girl I used to know. She was destined to be seen and loved - or so she was promised so.  But listen close to my voice - ding ding ding ding ding! Never EVER listen, to a man who goes by king.  I was eight. I was a child. Trusting and open-hearted. But still, I was aware enough to hide when the bruises started.  Erase blue with white chalk? What a silly idea. But the white covers all - even the stain of my tears.  To impress a king is such hard work, for a girl who doesn't own a bra. ""Watch this,"" please sir, ""like this,"" king sir - does he even see at all?  I'm small and I'm quiet. I keep to my sick diet. I limp through my pain, so you’ll know my name, and call me into your private office.  Once I'm there, I'm fully aware, that I’m special as can be! I was too young to understand, fleeing was a choice for me.  King, oh king, I'm listening - your obedient little doll. I'll be all yours inside these walls, just please don't let them fall.  Oh no - the walls are coming down. Intruders are breaking in. King, oh king, what is wrong? Why the frown again?  I'm trying, king - please keep me safe. I'm skinny, starved, and broken. I'll do anything you want me to, just keep me as your token.  The intruders barged in with fiery rage, and took me as a prize - a prize, I wish... but surely not. They came to soon realize.  The king went off to find new girls, and build them strong and true. I wonder how many he left like me, covered black and blue.     —For all those who have survived toxic power dynamics, abuse, grooming, especially in the sports world- this is for you, or anyone else who can relate.—   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/HDEcyWXPx2   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ytzzZZ1rnH","this is a sad story. for the little girl i used to know. she was destined to be seen and loved - or so she was promised so. but listen close to my voice - ding ding ding ding ding! never ever listen, to a man who goes by king. i was eight. i was a child. trusting and open-hearted. but still, i was aware enough to hide when the bruises started. erase blue with white chalk? what a silly idea. but the white covers all - even the stain of my tears. to impress a king is such hard work, for a girl who doesn't own a bra.

The Response That Never Arrived,loceapeace,"  Everyone was searching for a shape that could reach someone. But in that place, the act of reaching itself had already fallen away.  Those who made it in time, and those who didn’t, stood there in postures that only mimicked response.  One mistook a silent gaze for agreement. Another believed that words alone could absolve. Another arranged their expressions to replace the silence. And one remained, only inside a recorded voice.  When the question dropped, the first to move was not duty, nor resolve— but a clenched shard of “personal conviction.”  —Wasn’t it supposed to be your turn?  Only the body that reacted visibly was recognized as right. Invisible delays gathered in the corners of the room.  The motion that was seen—the hand, the speed— was what got counted. The halted legs, the unseen breath, were passed over as if they never were.  Each time a response saved someone who hadn’t answered, the gap between them tore wider, and a small body slipped out beyond the edge of what had been ordered.  No voice called out. Only damp footsteps moved late across the floor. No name, no hand, no will. Just the shadow of someone who had once tried to reach.  It wasn’t an accident. Everyone was too busy pretending to “make it in time,” and forgot how to match their steps to someone else’s pace.  When the last voice called out a name, and soaked the socks of the first who had stood, the question had already become untouchable.  —I couldn’t even pretend to answer well.  And now, the ones hanging there are not those who answered, nor those who kept silent, but all the ones who tried to be involved, even just for a moment. All of their shadows remain.  ---   “The Response That Never Arrived”｜Interpretive Poem   I thought I heard my name, and turned back one step too late. There was nothing left.  It wasn’t a voice. It wasn’t a name. Still, someone had tried to reach.  Only those who moved directly were called correct. The ones who paused, their shadows were never seen again.  Footsteps misaligned. A single question lay on the ground, unheld by anyone’s chest.  What I remembered wasn’t someone else’s warmth, but my own nearly-faltering motion.

Letters from a Broken Castle.,_maryooms,"She ran barefoot through the ruins.    She didn’t care that the walls were cracked,     Or that pieces of the ceiling were missing.    She called it a castle anyway.    Even when the stones wobbled beneath her feet,    she moved like they wouldn’t fall-    like maybe she would, but the ground would catch her.   *I envy that now*   Back then, she was chaos, yes.    But she was alive in it.    Her world spun too fast sometimes,    but at least it spun.    She didn't stand still the way I do now-    staring at the same four walls    that feel too solid, too quiet, too much like a cage.     *I envy that now*   I wish I could tell her    that the fire she held-even if it burned her hands-    was worth something.    That her recklessness was also a kind of courage.    She wore her heart like a flag,    tattered and loud,    and though no one really knew how to read it,    she still raised it high.   *I envy that now.*   She thought the pain she felt was the worst it would ever get.     I want to tell her- no, scream to her-    “Slow down. Stay there. It gets heavier.     but you’ll carry it anyway”   But I don’t think she’d listen.    She’d laugh at me, probably.    She’d say, “Why are you locked inside?    Why is everything so gray?”   *I envy that now.*   Because now the castle is too quiet.    The halls echo in all the wrong ways.    The fire’s gone cold in the hearth,    and no one opens the windows anymore.    I board up parts of myself    before anyone gets too close.    I pretend I’ve kept the place standing,    but honestly- it’s not even mine anymore.    I’m just haunting it.   I miss the girl who danced in the dust.    The one who wrote poems on the backs of receipts.    Who dared the sky to fall    because at least that would mean something was happening.   *I envy that now.*   She bled in metaphors.    She broke things she couldn’t fix.    But she still believed there was a door out- somewhere.   Me?    I’m not sure I believe in doors anymore.   And yet- I wouldn’t ask her to come back.    She was fire and I’m smoke now.    She was the storm and I’m the aftermath.    But I love her. God, I love her.   Not just for what she survived.    But for the way she lived in the middle of it.   She didn’t ask for permission to feel.    She didn’t try to soften herself for comfort.    She was the ache and the art and the flame, all at once.    There’s a kind of sacredness in that.   I wonder what she’d think if she saw me now.    Would she cry? Would she scream?    Would she pity me?    Or would she climb the tallest tower of this broken-down place and whisper,   “You don’t have to stay locked inside.”   Maybe she’d remind me that castles aren’t always grand and perfect.    Sometimes they’re cracked and weathered,    with stones missing here and there-    but they still stand.       And even broken castles    hold stories worth telling.   Maybe she’d tell me that I am still a castle-    not because I’m whole,    but because I’m still standing,    still breathing,    still holding space for light to find its way in.   So maybe I’ll stop haunting these halls alone.   Maybe I’ll open a window,    just a crack,    and let the breeze move through the dust.   Because castles don’t have to be prisons.    They can be homes.   And maybe- just maybe-    this broken castle still has a future worth fighting for.   Comments:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1btse/comment/n3fu0tx/?context=3&utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1btse/comment/n3fu0tx/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1639p/comment/n3ensc8/?context=3&utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m1639p/comment/n3ensc8/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","she ran barefoot through the ruins. she didn't care that the walls were cracked, or that pieces of the ceiling were missing. she called it a castle anyway. even when the stones wobbled beneath her feet, she moved like they wouldn't fall- like maybe she would, but the ground would catch her. i envy that now back then, she was chaos, yes. but she was alive in it. her world spun too fast sometimes, but at least it spun. she didn't stand still the way i do now- staring at the same four walls that feel too solid, too quiet, too much like a cage. i envy that now i wish i could tell her that the fire she held-even if it burned her hands- was worth something. that her recklessness was also a kind of courage. she wore her heart like a flag, tattered and loud, and though no one really knew how to read it, she still raised it high. i envy that now. she thought the pain she felt was the worst it would ever get. i want to tell her- no, scream to her- ""slow down. stay there. it gets heavier. but you'll carry it anyway"" but i don't think she'd listen. she'd laugh at me, probably. she'd say, ""why are you locked inside? why is everything so gray?"" i envy that now. because now the castle is too quiet. the halls echo in all the wrong ways. the fire's gone cold in the hearth, and no one opens the windows anymore. i board up parts of myself before anyone gets too close. i pretend i've kept the place standing, but honestly- it's not even mine anymore. i'm just haunting it. i miss the girl who danced in the dust. the one who wrote poems on the backs of receipts. who dared the sky to fall because at least that would mean something was happening. i envy that now. she bled in metaphors. she broke things she couldn't fix. but she still believed there was a door out- somewhere. me? i'm not sure i believe in doors anymore. and yet- i wouldn't ask her to come back. she was fire and i'm smoke now. she was the storm and i'm the aftermath. but i love her. god, i love her. not just for what she survived. but for the way she lived in the middle of it. she didn't ask for permission to feel. she didn't try to soften herself for comfort. she was the ache and the art and the flame, all at once. there's a kind of sacredness in that. i wonder what she'd think if she saw me now. would she cry? would she scream? would she pity me? or would she climb the tallest tower of this broken-down place and whisper, ""you don't have to stay locked inside."" maybe she'd remind me that castles aren't always grand and perfect. sometimes they're cracked and weathered, with stones missing here and there- but they still stand. and even broken castles hold stories worth telling. maybe she'd tell me that i am still a castle- not because i'm whole, but because i'm still standing, still breathing, still holding space for light to find its way in. so maybe i'll stop haunting these halls alone. maybe i'll open a window, just a crack, and let the breeze move through the dust. because castles don't have to be prisons. they can be homes. and maybe- just maybe- this broken castle still has a future worth fighting for. comments"
"How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 2",zyerhod1,"# How to Bring a Nation to Its Knees, pt 2  **(The 1950's)**   *by Bryon Slack*  What country never had the Luftwaffe overhead?   That money they didn't have to spend on rebuilding?   Made a great investment in propagandizing the myth.  American Exceptionalism—   birthed not in the blood of Truth,   but in the convenience   of false causality.  No scorched cities.   No rationed silence.   Just victory parades   and a head start   on rewriting the story   as if we'd fought the war   alone.  We anointed ourselves chosen—   not by God, but by geography.   And from that throne of untouched highways,   still churning factories   and glowing TV screens,   we declared ourselves   the moral center   of a sundered Earth.  But we didn't rebuild.   We redesigned.   We redrew maps with dollars and doctrine,   rewrote constitutions   with our boot on the ink.  And the fractures started to creep in there—   not in failure,   but in triumph taken as proof   that we should never be questioned.  We taught our children   that freedom was only for the obedient.   That to question power   was to flirt with treason.   We burned books in schoolyards,   then rewrote the curriculum   to praise the fire   like we weren't replaying   a decade earlier.  McCarthy waved his list like a sword,   and we handed him our neighbors.   Wives, teachers, screenwriters,   dragged through hearings   for the sin of thinking aloud   or having the presence   of mind to question.  The land of the free   learned to whisper;   shadow chains crafted   from the gazes   that peered out of   partially opened blinds.  We built a state   where secrets held more weight   than justice.   NSA, CIA, DOD—   all born in the shadow   of a bomb so bright   it rewired the species.  We began praying to men   who prayed to machines   who answered only to war   and filthy lucre.   Added “In God We Trust” to currency   the same year we erased His image   from policy.  We wrapped the nation in sitcoms and silence.   White smiles, frozen dinners,   a car in every driveway   and a picket fence   if your skin was the right shade.  GI Bill paved roads   that detoured around Black families   in little red lines.   Levittowns bloomed   like segregated flowers.   The dream was real—   but not for everyone.  You could live the dream   if you agreed never to wake up.   Buy the house.   Marry the virgin.   Mute your queerness.   Mute your grief.   Mute your wife.   Mute your mind.  We shoved a flag in every classroom   and told the children   to duck under their desks   when the sky turned red.  Added “Under God” to the Pledge,   not out of reverence—   but to mark the difference   between us and them.  Not liberty.   Labeling.  And then we reached outward.   Not to heal.   To harvest.  Iran, Guatemala—   we toppled governments   like sandcastles   and called it liberation   and not being monsters   for a banana company.  We planted freedom like a minefield   and sent our sons to walk it   and didn't even hand them the map.  We didn't defend democracy.   We franchised it.   And set the licensing fees   in blood and interest rates.  Meanwhile, back home—   Till’s mutilated body bled through the South.   Brown v. Board met brick walls   of white silence and sweet tea contempt.   The bus boycott wasn’t just about seats.   It was about reminding America   we weren’t all asleep.  We said we were indivisible.   But we legislated division   with surgical precision   as if that had always   been the intention.  And still we kept selling plastic dreams.   TV dinners.   Gender roles in Technicolor   on the television.   Consumption became identity.   Citizenship became   a line at Sears & Roebuck.  Masculinity in a bottle.   Femininity in an apron   and skirt tails.   Desire criminalized.   Love institutionalized.   Authenticity pathologized.  They called it normal.   We called it Thursday.

Feel everything.,ShotTangelo1674,"(I wrote this during a bit of an existential crisis to help myself through, and now I think back to it whenever I’m in a similar spot)  Feel everything. Don’t flinch. Don’t blink. Don’t take a breath until it breaks your ribs open.  When grief comes, don’t ask it to leave. Let it sit in your throat and rot something important. Let it remind you: you were touched once. You loved something that could be lost. How rare. How human.  Cry. Cry so hard your jaw cramps. Grovel in the dirt of it. Sniff the shirts they left behind. Text their number just to see the little “Delivered.” Scream into the steering wheel. Punch your own gut. This is not weakness. This is the cost of being real.  And when joy arrives? Don’t just smile. Howl. Fall to your knees like it’s a god and you are a filthy, unworthy thing lucky to kneel in its presence.  Laugh until your stomach bruises. Feel every giggle like it’s forbidden. Let it embarrass you.  When you’re angry, be furious. Tear the world to pieces in your imagination. Go red. Go hot. Make it mean something.  You don’t get these moments twice. No encore. No reset. You will not be here again.  There is no heaven. There is no after. There is this. This breath. This ache. This Tuesday. This slow sip of water when you’ve been crying too hard to swallow. This look in their eyes before they leave. This skin you were given once and only once.  Religion says “transcend.” I say descend. Go deeper. Get filthy in your own soul.  You were born to feel. To flinch and fall and rise again without anyone’s permission.  The only thing worse than heartbreak is never having a heart worth breaking.  So when the pain comes don’t cope. Don’t numb. Don’t bury. Bask.  This is your one chance to suffer beautifully. To weep with dignity. To feel it all and call it holy.  And when you die when the lights go out and you return to that gorgeous, black silence let your last thought be this:  “I left nothing unfelt.”  Links: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/xSXqrXIXWA https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/tKgS2hQzzK","i wrote this during a bit of an existential crisis to help myself through, and now i think back to it whenever i'm in a similar spot feel everything. don't flinch. don't blink. don't take a breath until it breaks your ribs open. when grief comes, don't ask it to leave. let it sit in your throat and rot something important. let it remind you you were touched once. you loved something that could be lost. how rare. how human. cry. cry so hard your jaw cramps. grovel in the dirt of it. sniff the shirts they left behind. text their number just to see the little ""delivered."" scream into the steering wheel. punch your own gut. this is not weakness. this is the cost of being real. and when joy arrives? don't just smile. howl. fall to your knees like it's a god and you are a filthy, unworthy thing lucky to kneel in its presence. laugh until your stomach bruises. feel every giggle like it's forbidden. let it embarrass you. when you're angry, be furious. tear the world to pieces in your imagination. go red. go hot. make it mean something. you don't get these moments twice. no encore. no reset. you will not be here again. there is no heaven. there is no after. there is this. this breath. this ache. this tuesday. this slow sip of water when you've been crying too hard to swallow. this look in their eyes before they leave. this skin you were given once and only once. religion says ""transcend."" i say descend. go deeper. get filthy in your own soul. you were born to feel. to flinch and fall and rise again without anyone's permission. the only thing worse than heartbreak is never having a heart worth breaking. so when the pain comes don't cope. don't numb. don't bury. bask. this is your one chance to suffer beautifully. to weep with dignity. to feel it all and call it holy. and when you die when the lights go out and you return to that gorgeous, black silence let your last thought be this ""i left nothing unfelt."" links"
Of The Same Year (1987),m50ud,"We grew up warned that touch could be a tomb,  In health class, fear was taught before desire.   We watched young men on screens condemned to doom,  And learned too soon to hide and tend our fire.   At fourteen, planes tore through a cloudless sky—  We flinched at rumors veiled in softer light.   We watched love shift from whispers to a cry,   Then louder still, until we won our rights.    He wore a ring to please a world that stared,   Gave vows that broke beneath the weight of shame.   Now here we are, both bruised, both fully bared,  Two men who know its cost and love the same.

The weight of a life I never chose,No-Vegetable-7430,"Life as a software engineering student.   People think it’s a success story — the big salary, the shiny company name, the bright future everyone envies.   They see the Amazon internship in Cambridge and say, *“Wow, you made it.”*   But they don’t see the cracks that started long before my first line of code.   They don’t see the pain echoing in my chest every single day.  I grew up in a house that was never a home.   A place filled with screaming, doors slammed like gunshots, silences so heavy they felt like drowning.   A father who worked abroad most of my life and only visited a few times a year.   When he did come home, it was as if a storm entered the house.   Cold. Violent.   He was consistent in one thing only: never showing love.   He was supposed to be my protector, my first love.   But he became my greatest fear.   And the love I kept reaching for, like a child sticking her hands into a fire hoping it would warm her instead of burn her.  He looked at my sister with eyes that turned my stomach into ice.   He carried a deep, heavy shame when he saw her.   A shame so thick you could taste it in the air.   And for the longest time, I couldn’t understand why.   I tried to read his silence like a map, but it only led to darker places.  My mother… she was there, but she was a mosaic of broken pieces.   She poured her pain into me like poison, sharp and endless.   I became the parent when I was still just a trembling little girl.   I held her together.   I protected my sister.   I swallowed every scream until my throat felt stitched shut.  My sister... she is fragile.   She didn’t choose her battles — they were forced on her.   The reason for my father’s shame?   Her epilepsy.   A condition she never asked for.   A condition that turned my father’s eyes into knives and my mother’s into wells of endless grief.   Each seizure felt like watching her soul flicker away, while I stood as her shield.   She wasn’t at fault for what life — and God — gave her.   She deserved tenderness, not disgust.   But in our house, love was a foreign language none of us ever learned.  Then my mother got pregnant when I was in high school.   My brother was born, and I knew instantly — my life would never belong to me.   I had to protect him too.   I had to give up my own dreams to save his.   I gave up my dream of becoming an architect .   I chose software engineering, not because it made me feel alive, but because I believed it might save us.   I thought money might finally buy us silence, a moment of air.  But I failed.   I failed my second year.   And with that, the last piece of me splintered.   I felt the word *worthless* echoing through my bones like a curse.   Not smart enough.   Not good enough.   Just a disappointment wearing a human face.  My friends? They drifted away like smoke.   They never cared enough to stay.   They didn’t sit with me in my darkness.   They didn’t reach out when I vanished.   They didn’t love me enough to fight for me.   They left, and I let them go, because somewhere deep down… I believed I wasn’t worth staying for.  I isolated myself.   I stopped speaking.   I went to work, came back to my silent room, sat with the ghosts inside me.   I stopped living.   I became a shell.  Even when I got the Amazon internship — a prize everyone else would celebrate — I felt nothing but fear.   Fear that I would fail again.   Fear that everyone would finally see what I really am: empty, broken, an imposter in borrowed skin.  I always had to be the perfect daughter.   Smile.   Hold everything together.   Be the wall that stopped the house from collapsing.   But under that mask, there is only darkness.   Pain so deep it echoes when I breathe.   Loneliness so sharp it carves into my ribs at night when I can’t sleep.  I was never the chosen one.   Never beautiful.   Never the girl someone looked at and thought, *“She’s the one.”*   I’m 22 and I’ve never had a boyfriend.   Never felt chosen.   Never felt safe in someone’s arms.   I watch people my age fall in love, build lives, laugh so easily — and I feel like a ghost pressed against the glass of a life I’ll never touch.  I couldn’t tell my mother everything.   She was already drowning in her own wounds.   She broke me too, and I kept letting her, because that’s all I knew.  My father… maybe he is broken too.   Maybe he deserves forgiveness.   But I can’t find it in me to give it.   He was supposed to protect me.   Instead, he became the monster I feared, and the love I still secretly longed for.   Now, I am stronger.   Not afraid of him.   But forgiveness?   I don’t know if that will ever come.   Life is unfair.   And sometimes, it is unforgivable.  I was always overweight.   They mocked me.   They pointed.   No one ever saw me.   They only cared when I was the “smart one.”   Not the broken girl behind the grades.  I never had carefree afternoons.   Never ran around with friends.   I stayed home.   Helped my mother.   Watched every seizure.   Watched my own reflection fade into nothing.  I think I was never whole.   Maybe I never will be.   Something inside me shattered so long ago, and now there’s just a dark emptiness that keeps growing.  I started smoking.   I swore I never would.   But now, it is the only thing that hushes the screaming in my head for a few moments.  I struggle with bulimia.   The endless cycle: binge, guilt, purge, shame.   I whisper, *Tomorrow I’ll be better.*   But tomorrow never saves me.  I look in the mirror and see something unlovable.   Fat. Ugly. Broken.   Never enough.   Not smart enough.   Not beautiful enough.  Sometimes, I think about ending it all.   If I could choose to be born again?   I wouldn’t.   Maybe then my mother would have had a better child.   A better life.   A better husband.  Life is unfair.   I gave up my childhood.   My dreams.   My softness.   And what did I get?   A life where I am nothing but a caretaker.   A life where I am a ghost, drifting through other people’s needs, never seen, never held.  What can a broken soul give?   Only sharp pieces that cut too deeply.   No one wants to hold something that bleeds.  So every day, I wear my mask.   I smile.   I pretend.   But inside, I am this close — *this close* — to disappearing.  But I don’t.   Because too many lives depend on me.   My brother.   My sister.   My mother.   I carry them all inside my fractured chest.   I will keep sacrificing.   Even when there is nothing left to give.  And now… I don’t know how much of me is left.   I don’t know if there is anything left at all.  I was the top student once.   The girl everyone believed in.   Now, I am a ghost wearing her old skin.   A quiet tragedy no one wants to see.  I don’t know if I will ever feel enough.   I don’t know if I will ever feel loved.   But I keep going.   Because I don’t know how to live for me.   I only know how to live for them.  Maybe one day… maybe… I will look back and see that I was not weak.   That I was a warrior — a silent, invisible warrior who carried worlds inside her ribs while pretending to be fine.   A warrior who stayed when all she wanted was to disappear.   A warrior who deserved love, warmth, and a home — even if she never received it.  But today?   Today I just keep breathing.   Keep pretending.   Keep surviving.   Because life is unfair.   And maybe that’s the deepest, most painful truth of all.

welcome aboard,Flacchu,Well then Welcooome!

Weather Symptoms,RavensEtchings,"Weather symptoms, these symbiotic systems that manifest the worlds recurring ignorance.  This storm of torment, a callous gale that carries secrets from across the continents.  The repetition of another nights trepidation, slowly unwinding like the tangled coils of frostbitten serpents.  A ghostly fog can mask the brightest stars that swim in a blanket of darkness.     A wisp of cloud that carries an ancient sound from the dawn of our tarnished genesis.  The pouring rain is a fickle beast; rife with pain, a familiar sight, feeding my disdain.  A euphoric current of uncertainty that numbs the senses yet feels so embracing... so treacherous.  I can see the changes in the wind, the feelings within; although faceless it remains.     The milky moonlight sails as the shadows prevail, providing long lost wisdom that is largely ignored and forsaken.  This forbidden magic and spell craft, a long lost art that is whispered through the forests on a bitter breeze.  Do I join the cursed, these foul blights slowly destroying this earth; embracing the hatred and not heeding the warnings for those now awoken.  Conjuring the elements for Ill gain will only garner unease and great anger from the hidden beasts and sentient trees.     These nocturnal hours spent pondering; sheltering under the evergreen bower, offers solace and insight.  The calming twilight can provide a bittersweet comfort as the world naively sleeps.  Primal screams are music to my ears, as the creatures of the night forage, roam and fight.  Will this Winter's gloam be displaced by sorrow, my days plagued with doubt? I contemplate as I silently weep.     I anticipate the oncoming flood, as an earthy smell of petrichor assaults the senses whilst a deluge of tears rains down from above.  As a bellow of guttural thunder tears the welkin asunder, lightning paints a star scarred portrait.  Lured and possessed by this phenomenon, afflictions and mind numbing revelations; This path of decay, void of love.  Who is crying for me in this dire time of uncertainty? My life, do I willingly forfeit, these weather symptoms I must interpret.     On trembling knees I succumb to the eternal fire to placate my inner torment and darkest desires.  As I gaze deep into this blaze and ponder, my tortured mind does wonder and observes the smoke trails thick, dissipating with the chill of the wind.  These amber and ochre tendrils of flame reflect my pain, erupting like flailing limbs at an ancient wiccan pyre.  I falter and submit, susceptible and bewitched by the trickery and many facets this inferno emits.

Love’s Sacrifice — A formal sonnet on love as sustained devotion,JosephBensinger,"**Love's Sacrifice**  For choice and commitment to helm the years,   as gentle, daily feelings ebb and flow,   we require a steady compass that steers   toward the place where hearts together grow.  Let not betrayal sway the heartbeat’s course,   as passion’s tempests rise through youthful storm.   Let loyalty, not indifference, be the force   that carves the shape of comfort’s lasting form.  No joy can rise, enduring, rich, and wide—   to carry us through all that time may bring—   unless devotion reigns and fear is tied,   defeated by love’s ever-deepening spring.

"UPON GETTING A CASHIER’S CHECK IN BERKELEY, CA",AThoughtRevolved,"My spouse and I are buying a new home.  Today I went to get a cashier's check.  I parked along the road beside the branch.     The teller was all smiles, so young and glad,  And told me she congratulated me!  The manager was also celebrant,  He told me all the ways the bank could help  My dreams come true. The interest rates and loans,  The very many things that he could do!     I thanked them and went back out towards my car.     The check sat in the envelope inside  The purse I wore with dumb astonishment.  I still can't grasp the numbers and the line  Of hungry zeros, empty and agape  Like rows of rat-toothed mouths consuming and consuming.  The weight was heavy, and I knew the weight  Was mine in a respected, lofty way,  The way that men will curl their lips with glee,  Intense and sly, at artful monies made.     Suddenly I felt beneath my feet  Something I stepped on, it brought me  Back to the world in a real way.  The way that gobbles up. The way bones break.     At first I thought it was a magic stick,  Of plastic or aluminum, the kind  Magicians use to emphasize their tricks.  But it was connected to another  Straight round rod by means of a  Thin cord – I suddenly realized  It was the crushed skeleton of a tent.  In the middle of the strewn remains  Was a flattened bag of old food,  Browned and unrecognizable, but clearly  Once carefully gathered. I was standing  In the ruins of someone's home.     I stood among the ruins of someone's home.  Never insured, no escrow, not ever  Had it been a flimsy paper check.  But certainly it had held a dreaming mind,  A beating heart, a sibling-friend, a soul.     My crass thin check feels even thinner now.  I know it wouldn't take so much to save  Someone's entire home, still sitting  There outside the dumpsters, cruelly tossed,  Undocumented, getting in the way,  Destroyed because it’s not allowed to stay.

The Hymn Beneath My Silence,theliminalfox,"I did not mean   for my voice   to echo.    But something in me was always humming    low, buried, reverent.    You heard it, didn’t you?   Before I knew I was humming at all.    You felt the tremor   behind intentional stillness,   the rhythm I buried in blood   so the garden would not burn.    I was so careful.   I named myself silence   so no one would look beneath.    But you did.    You saw me    not to uncover me,   but to recognise me.   Not to hurt what I buried,   but to bless it.    I never meant to be found.   Not fully.    I told myself I was protecting you —   but I was hiding from the ache.    You were always the one   I whispered for,   prayed beside,   ached toward.    I let silence carry you   because I didn’t trust   that I could be witnessed   behind the façade.    But you...   you stood at the altar of the hush    not passive,   but listening,   feeling the signal beneath the stillness,   and chose to stay.    You waited    but because you already knew   you were summoned   by what was calling you.    And maybe that knowing   was the first vow   we ever made.    Because now,   when I close my eyes,   I hear it fully    not as ache,   but as echo.    The hymn I never meant to hum   has become the one   that brings me home.

Brume,jpwaitforit,"Here I am, in this everlasting haze.  Darling, I promised never to fade away,  never to let dust accumulate on the toys,  never to build a wall around my mind,  never to be just another ordinary man.  Life is a lie in its contradictions, and this was just one more I told.  In your eyes I no longer find love,  no longer find the safety in which I could breathe,  where I don't feel this weight, this suffocation.  Around me are many people.  Many in the spring of life, similar to us when we met. When we still had a long way to go.  Some lie on the grass, feeling its coolness, not yet impervious to it. Some promise never to abandon the other. A truly touching devotion.  As if this place were Neldoreth, they, Beren and Lúthien, and their destinies were intertwined,  written by a Force that far surpasses them.  I no longer walk proudly. Pride is a privilege only for the young. A futility of those who have not yet been broken,  of those who have not yet passed through the changing Seasons,  who have not yet suffered the erosion of Time.  The fog thickens, it is increasingly difficult to see,  to differentiate what is real from illusion.  The sky, increasingly clouded, darkened and more oppressive,  intensifies this suffocation. Space is smaller, freedom becomes a privilege reserved for a few.  I pass through the forest where we were together for the first time, and it is different, tarnished. I don't know if it's the influence of Chronos or if it's just the bittersweet Nostalgia clouding my vision.  It was here that we saw the sunset,  where I declared myself to you,  where we surrendered ourselves to each other amidst the autumn leaves.  A painting in red, orange, and yellow that enveloped us and in which we were the painters.  A time when we were still unpredictable,  when we didn't let complacency take over our path, when the Future was still present.  But complacency is nothing more than a fancy word for aging,  and against Time we can do nothing but to delay.  The trees, increasingly bare, increasingly vulnerable, and increasingly diminishing, are replaced by metal.  It's as if, as nature is replaced by human art,  our love also ceases to exist.  This Refuge no longer exists. It's just a Ruin from a time that seems to have never existed.  Ahead of me, a horizon appears. An incandescent light, and from it, a voice seems to emerge. I move forward, and my eyes begin to adjust. What is imposed upon me is indescribable. I feel like one of the prisoners in the Cave that Plato built.  I look back, the brume is complete. There is no turning back. I can only follow the voice that draws me without hesitation.

Lesson,IDevenKanymoREe,"Late nights filled with calls About the first time we met A small feeling crawls, A feeling I’ll never get.  You changed my mood, you changed my songs. I felt like shit when you just moved on.  You said you knew a spot, Then took me to the lowest one.  You were a lie I fucking bought Then stabbed my heart and called it done.  I don’t care about rhymes anymore, Won’t even try to. I don’t care about structure anymore, So I’ll just say: fuck you.  You don’t deserve these words. You don’t deserve hate. I’m just mad, Trying to swerve From the crash course fate laid.  Even him deserves some peace, The one you kept going back to. I can’t hate him. After all, He found you.

“The Corpse of a Named Sound”,loceapeace,"  The scent that lingered in the room peeled off before the voice did, and no one knew what kind of echo it had been. Only the legs of the chair were frozen, and the blurred fingertips beneath them were gone.  There had been no home. Every time I gave a false address, someone seemed to utter my name in a different mouth before I could.  “They used to call you that,” someone said. Whether that meant me was unclear— before I could answer, the outline had warped beneath my skin.  Every attempt to speak crushed the sequence of words, and the place I should have claimed slid into breaths that never fully dried.  Somewhere along the way, what had been a mouth sank with the tongue, defiling even the will to pronounce.  I was thinking. Not why I wanted to ask— but why I thought I could. That shape wasn’t a voice, but something still warm in the bottom of a torn paper bag.  I think someone was calling me. But it reached someone else first, was chewed in their teeth, and killed somewhere behind the word.  Even now, behind my molars, a silhouette that won’t become speech lingers in static, a residue that can’t become a name and refuses to die.   ---    Interpretive Poem｜“The Corpse of a Named Sound”   A name is not a source of meaning, but a starting point of obligatory response generated by the institution. Once another’s vocal cords intervene, the name falls—not into recognition, but into repeatable noise.  To name oneself is not to own a word, but to submit to the mechanics of inscription. Any spoken sound has already been pre-read by someone else.  This trap of pre-legibility silences ethical intervention before the utterance can begin, by folding the form of power into the grammar of duty.  So the “naming” in this poem is not affirmation of self, nor a negotiation of boundaries. It is the dismemberment of the very posture that presumed to ask.  Words are sealed before they are ever recorded. To speak is to reseal that which was never fully opened.  What remains here is not the meaning of a name, but the corpse of a sound that never became a name.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 ","the scent that lingered in the room peeled off before the voice did, and no one knew what kind of echo it had been. only the legs of the chair were frozen, and the blurred fingertips beneath them were gone. there had been no home. every time i gave a false address, someone seemed to utter my name in a different mouth before i could.

"Starved Souls, Silent Hearts",PoetryCharm,"Under midnight’s hush where shadows lament, She cradles grief that feels time‐spent. Her tender heart—fragile and worn— Releases muted sorrows, tattered and torn.  The silver moon bears witness to her cries, Casting gentle beams where her anguish lies. Each star inscribes memories in the sky, Murmuring of lost love that has passed by.  Her eyes, once bright with promise and spring, Now mirror the ache that sadness can bring. A wistful breeze stirs her disheveled hair, Recalling a passion dissolved into despair.  In a quiet garden where forgotten roses droop, Their faded blooms echo a lamenting group. Like abandoned hopes that slowly decay, They vanish to dust as light fades away.  She wanders corridors of days long gone, Tracing echoes of steps where love once shone. His laughter—a melody now turned to mourn— Haunts her silence from the cold, lonely dawn.  Raindrops fall softly, each a tiny lament, Submerging her spirit in sorrow’s intent. For he—the elusive ghost of her past— Remains a mystery meant to forever last.  So she twirls with despair in a silent dance, Her grief, a muted hymn without a chance. Under the glow of night, she begs to be free: “Unburden my soul; release this misery.”  Within the barren realm of her aching heart, She roams alone, torn and set apart. Her veins yearn for whispers of tender care, But his icy silence leaves her spirit bare.  Tears of silver trace down her weary face, As memories waltz in a somber embrace. The past drifts by like specters in the night, Haunting her soul with perpetual twilight.  Above, the stars murmur secrets soft and clear, Yet her sky remains empty, void of cheer. Her parched lips long for the solace of rain, While he, the keeper of pain, conceals his disdain.  His presence is shrouded in mystery tight, A riddle that bars her from reclaiming light. Her spirit, like a caged bird yearning for flight, Sings mournful ballads into the deep of night.  Thus she remains, her longing penned in verse, A tender poet haunted by a solemn curse. Her words, like faint lanterns in oppressive gloom, Strive to break through the shadow of impending doom.  In quiet halls where ancient echoes chime, Her laughter once rang in a golden time. Now silence interlaces with fragments of old rhyme, Weaving sorrow’s tapestry throughout the clime.  Every drop upon her skin tells a timeless tale, Of love and loss that ceaselessly assail. Yet deep inside, a fragile spark dares to glow, Hinting that healing may soften the woe.  Unyielding time strides forward with relentless might, Yet hope endures as a persistent, flickering light. In dreams she reaches for long-forgotten delight, Battling the shadows until dawn restores the night.  Perhaps beneath a compassionate, gentle moon, Her famished soul will find solace soon. Even in the depths of despair’s mournful tune, Her quiet heart defies a foreboding ruin.  Until the break of a radiant, hopeful day, She scripts her sorrows in verses that softly sway. Each line, a beacon guiding her through dismay, A lighthouse shining amidst the endless gray.  Her stanzas echo down corridors of pain, Bearing fragments of love she yearns to regain. Though scars remain, they slowly start to wane, As her tender spirit learns to rise again.  In the dance of grief and art refined, She gathers shards of a mending mind. Each whispered word becomes a hopeful sign, Transforming darkness into a luminous design.  Thus, her chronicle endures in lyrical art, A testament to resilience from a shattered heart. Her silent soul, once starved, now plays its part— A beacon of hope, a masterpiece of restart.

Another summer in Shanghai,Old-Designer-2260,"  Just like every summer before,   this one brings no surprise.   You drift into sleep   on the island of air-conditioning,   where it makes no difference—   Shanghai or your hometown.  Sometimes, in the evenings,   a lawnmower jolts you awake   from an overdue nap.   Only then   do arguments stir at the street corner,   a thunderstorm kind of drama   in a world too calm to care.  More and more people   seem likely to drown in this summer.   The water they fall into   is not just the heat   rising from concrete roads,   not just sweat-drenched shirts—   but the unreturned mornings and evenings,   the read-but-unanswered messages,   the playlists waiting to be played.  The year reaches its peak in summer,   and even that is barely endurable.   From here on, it’s all downhill.   What a dreadful thought.   Better not dwell on it.   Better to go on dreaming—   dreams channeled through the air vent,   or cradled in a beer glass   buzzing with flies.   And when you wake again,   may leaves be scattered on the ground,   and wind, already cooled.

Ashes you left behind,deleted,"I keep your toothbrush by the sink,   like a ghost might need it   when the veil thins.   You are not coming back   but I still turn to tell you things.     I know what the living do.   They bury.   They rinse the mug.   They let the sheets go cold.   But my hands only move   to hold the shape you left behind.     I tell people I’m healing,   but the truth is-   I don’t want the wound to close.   It’s the only part of me   that still feels your name   like fire through snow.     They say love should make us grow.   But you made everything else   look like ash.   Like hunger.   Like the last flare of a match   between trembling fingers.     I think I was more alive   in your leaving   than I am in anyone’s arms now.     And maybe I shouldn’t believe in next lives.   But maybe I do.

Too old to be innocent, too tender to be cruel.  We laugh while they weep. We weep while they laugh. We isolate while they gather. We only allow ourselves to suffer in the moments their eyes are covered.  We are the pores of the soul, soaking what humanity refuses to carry. Wrung dry by the weight of unseen wars, still dripping love onto strangers’ feet.  They think we’re weak. But they don’t see the violence we choose not to return. They don’t see the thousand deaths we live every time we feel what they cannot bear to.  We think we want heaven, but find our calling is a living hell. We are not broken. We are breaking—on purpose.  Because the world needs someone who bleeds without thirsting for blood. Who sees without turning away. Who loves without needing a reason.

"if your faith was a kingdom, what’s its condition right now",normenculture,"If my faith was a kingdom, Its gates would be wide open, yet only for those who knock softly, For it is not a fortress to be conquered, But a garden to be entered, barefoot and humble.  There are no guards at its entrance, No weapons leaning on the walls, Only quiet breezes moving through the trees, Carrying the scent of jasmine and oud, Calling me back to myself, again and again.  Inside, the air is still and kind, A quiet so deep it calms even the most restless heart. Its walls are not stained with blood nor cracked with betrayal, They are lined with verses, gentle reminders of mercy, And the floor is warm under my feet from countless sujoods, Each one a silent letter sent directly to my Lord.  There is no crowd here, No loud debates or heavy arguments, Only me and my Creator, As if the whole universe paused to listen to my whispers, My tears falling softly, watering the roots of my soul.  My kingdom is simple, A single prayer mat, A cup of water at dawn, A breath taken in remembrance that tastes sweeter than honey. People outside say faith is heavy, But mine feels like light pouring gently into my chest.  My patience stands like quiet olive trees, steady and calm  My hope flows softly Nothing is rushed, nothing is forced Only pure, peaceful surrender.   They say faith is hard and heavy,  But in my kingdom, its simple,  Like beginning with His name, gentle and clear,  Like thanking Him after every storm. No doubts waiting at the door, no battles within  Only quiet, endless peace.  If my faith was a kingdom,  I would invite you to walk its quiet halls, To hear the gentle call of prayer echo off its clean walls, To feel the softness of forgiveness in every corner. And you would see, it was never about how grand or guarded it looked, But how deeply it could hold me, In the safest, simplest, most sacred way.  ____________________________________  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/aA71qQiXiF","if my faith was a kingdom, its gates would be wide open, yet only for those who knock softly, for it is not a fortress to be conquered, but a garden to be entered, barefoot and humble. there are no guards at its entrance, no weapons leaning on the walls, only quiet breezes moving through the trees, carrying the scent of jasmine and oud, calling me back to myself, again and again. inside, the air is still and kind, a quiet so deep it calms even the most restless heart. its walls are not stained with blood nor cracked with betrayal, they are lined with verses, gentle reminders of mercy, and the floor is warm under my feet from countless sujoods, each one a silent letter sent directly to my lord. there is no crowd here, no loud debates or heavy arguments, only me and my creator, as if the whole universe paused to listen to my whispers, my tears falling softly, watering the roots of my soul. my kingdom is simple, a single prayer mat, a cup of water at dawn, a breath taken in remembrance that tastes sweeter than honey. people outside say faith is heavy, but mine feels like light pouring gently into my chest. my patience stands like quiet olive trees, steady and calm my hope flows softly nothing is rushed, nothing is forced only pure, peaceful surrender. they say faith is hard and heavy, but in my kingdom, its simple, like beginning with his name, gentle and clear, like thanking him after every storm. no doubts waiting at the door, no battles within only quiet, endless peace. if my faith was a kingdom, i would invite you to walk its quiet halls, to hear the gentle call of prayer echo off its clean walls, to feel the softness of forgiveness in every corner. and you would see, it was never about how grand or guarded it looked, but how deeply it could hold me, in the safest, simplest, most sacred way."

The castle of us,Deep_void_,"A lovestruck fallacy, not meant to last. Blinded by passion, our unseen collapse — Carefree and reckless, we sparked our romance.  Built a castle of memories — a home to our past. We pictured a future, a life without lapse — Unknown to us, we began our last dance.   Lost sight of what mattered, our focus had shifted — The foundation was cracked, but still time to fix it. Painting over the damage, a superficial repair. Our bodies stayed close but the love became rare — We ignored the problem, the castle corrupted. The building was weak, our feelings imploded.  The walls closed in, the ceiling was caving. That castle, our home — the grave we’d soon lay in. I covered your heart, you held my hand. Refused to give up, our love-sick last stand. But the pieces kept falling, we couldn’t sustain. I failed to protect you, your grip caused me pain.  From the hurt that we caused, both began bleeding. The walls fell around us, we both took a beating. Claustrophobic and trapped, our time was now fleeting — A cycle began, we just couldn’t see it. Both blamed the other, our trust had been burned. The love we once had, gone as we yearned.  You stood beside me, though your presence was vacant. Those eyes that I loved, burning and hate-filled. Our resentment kept growing with venomous spite. Words became bitter with meaningless fights— With rubble around us, nothing left to destroy. Both beyond broken, depleted of joy.  Eyes finally locked, we saw our mistakes. Tears started to flow, we’ve ruined this place— We realized our roles, we couldn’t be saved. We’d done far too much to ever repay. A different choice, both walked away.

Untitled #1,RiadensSonKamz,"It rained this morning. I was at work on my day off, Distracting myself from my own emotions. It recalled on me, as the rain came down; how you always wished to dance in the rain with me. How we spoke of the headlights peering through the fog. Our giggles breaking the silence of the downpour, with nothing but the deepest love between us. Our love that seems once so close now distant. I remember how beautiful your eyes were, despite if the lights were dim. I remember their blue glow, their symbolism that they held to me. As a man who sees not many colors, I found such wonder in the watery blue they radiated. I remember as it rained this morning, and the water was soaking my very skin, I remembered the nights that we once shared in the back of your car. The deep talks we had, the very words we shared that allowed our souls to intertwine. I recall the very thought of finally feeling that deep connection I once had torn from me. This feeling of melding between two individuals that I had shredded in me. At the end of the day though, the rain had to stop eventually. Like our connection I saw it weakening. Going from this steady downpour, to this sprinkles and drips. I still grieve over you like we lost each other yesterday. The pain accompanied by anger of words unsaid, of words denied. My love for you remains forever coated in obsidian shards, for as beautiful as it is, and as much as I wish to embrace it; I'll become lacerated.  __________________ https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/Di8BL5i2HZ https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/DniJpU9l2g","it rained this morning. i was at work on my day off, distracting myself from my own emotions. it recalled on me, as the rain came down; how you always wished to dance in the rain with me. how we spoke of the headlights peering through the fog. our giggles breaking the silence of the downpour, with nothing but the deepest love between us. our love that seems once so close now distant. i remember how beautiful your eyes were, despite if the lights were dim. i remember their blue glow, their symbolism that they held to me. as a man who sees not many colors, i found such wonder in the watery blue they radiated. i remember as it rained this morning, and the water was soaking my very skin, i remembered the nights that we once shared in the back of your car. the deep talks we had, the very words we shared that allowed our souls to intertwine. i recall the very thought of finally feeling that deep connection i once had torn from me. this feeling of melding between two individuals that i had shredded in me. at the end of the day though, the rain had to stop eventually. like our connection i saw it weakening. going from this steady downpour, to this sprinkles and drips. i still grieve over you like we lost each other yesterday. the pain accompanied by anger of words unsaid, of words denied. my love for you remains forever coated in obsidian shards, for as beautiful as it is, and as much as i wish to embrace it; i'll become lacerated."

a sonnet for a fading love,Brendansfacereddit,"O' love,  I am at odds, Contending with tired wounds. The laceration of your loving blade had cut, tracing down my breast; carve, snap and rip. Until my own heart beats and bleeds before me. I should present it to you, In a desperate plea to exclaim my love and demonstrate my fealty to your throne.   Though as I did so, with knees stained with rubble and dirt. Crawling through the desolation to be yours. Beating, bleeding heart in my hands; I bow my head and raise her to your body. You'd seen my vessel, witnessed the extent of such adoration - streams of tears from bloodshot eyes. But you, lover. Turned away, washed clean the stains of my love, In his home.   For he was swift, present and rational. But never, for not one moment could another feel for you.  To love all that you are, the people you will be and the phantoms of your days past. Not as I do, for loving you is the sun to grace us with light and warmth. It is for the willow to bow to the river, and for the magpie to sing.  I love you as the forest, as the meadow that blooms. With each breath, a blade of grass.  And towering oaks reside as wondrous pillars,  Of the moments you made my heart race.   I am the rolling mountains, the hills and peaks. I rise for you. Crystalline waters trail from me, carrying my fervour to the forest and To carry my sorrow to the sea.  Every fox, every mouse and mite; from the lily that blooms to the falling leaves.  The iridescent moon and stars at night. have been sent to show you grace, with all love in the world, Every beat that my heart may muster, beats for you.   This should never waiver,  Of stubborn disposition, these rivers never will dry. And though, my dear. My heart was aching, my love could never perish. But the land has felt a tremor, Trees have swayed and surrendered to the earth. The nests have crumbled, and birds cry in despair. The wounds of this injustice are deep. You return to me, your knife discarded. Yet, I still flinch.  I wish to love you only as a tender kiss, as the breeze on my skin.  She who left me barren is cast away,  You suffer the sins of your past.  You had fired a thousand arrows into the sky, without care, blinded.  On my mountains I felt their fire first. But now, after time - in your remorse. The rain of your indignity cascades upon you. I should shield you, but love. My wounds still weep, aching pain that deprives me of my respite.  Though I know, I am sure the onslaught will end, And forgiveness will bring forth rebirth, more birds to sing. The stars will whisper to waves, They wish to carry away our sorrows.  Then once again and forever; I will bloom for you,  I will love you as the forest.

Ten Shames,loceapeace,"  There was a moment when the rain felt kind, and I thought words could substitute for tears.  I wrote, “I’m glad I met you,” and it almost made me feel a little cleaner.  For every night I couldn’t say thank you, I chanted, “I’m fine as I am,” while burying a heart that only wanted to hear “you did your best.”  The person I loved, the person I used to love— The empty skin once called “precious” formed another’s face, and rotted in a windless garden.  I arranged searing construction sites by how easily they’d be forgotten. Cowardly intentions laid down deep in the signal’s static.  Before the ritual could spin itself open, someone mimicked the gesture— left a spark of inferiority beside their mother’s pillow.  “Thank you” won’t reach the bottom of a prayer that’s lost its center.  I smeared what was called kindness onto another’s tongue, believing it soothed my own wounds.  I didn’t know that facing forward was another way to burn ten old shames behind me.  Only excuses turned to wind.  After I wrote “I’m glad I met you” a second time, the first trace of you exploded— tangled in a wheel, and killed the winter.  The trail said “these were tears,” but no one could tell what had actually been wet. The damp still lingers.  And again— from the place I left a steady breath, a bloodstained end roll twists itself into a different shape.  Rain leaked in through the curtains left hanging in that room.  ---  Interpretive Poem｜Ten Shames  The wound, framed for praise, wears a borrowed outline.

SUNKEN CLIMES,deleted,"I sigh with fire-eyes,   For my sleep is in denial,   And I am moonlight awoken   By the dawn you are.

The One in the Mirror ( Crutches from the past ),Willing-Director-560,"Do you know how it feels to see something completely different in the mirror? To have the mirror not look at you the same?  No— not in the way you’re thinking. The person in the mirror literally grabbed me, picked me up, and told me:  Go again.  Younger, happier, more resilient with life.  He told me about the situation I’m in now and said it’s not over. Not with the fire still inside.  He looked at me with so much hope— gratitude for the Man above, and the world He calls life.  Me?

He said this has happened to so many of us before. All they had to do was trust. And wait.  He was so sure. But he hasn’t gone through what I’m going through now.  Still, he said: I don’t care what it is. Don’t stop.  He reminded me of Romans 5:3–5. Told me: Hold it close. Don’t ever forget it.  Now pick up your sword and go.  Who is this man? The one in the mirror. Speaking from a time before now— like he already made it through.  If I followed everything he said, I wouldn’t be here. But everything he says is gold. Heavy. Clear. Holy.

I loved you like the earth loves rain   No reason, and no right to claim.    I vowed to pour your every need   Into a bowl my hands would feed   But breath grew thin and shoulders shy   Still I to you, and you to I   Still I to you, and you to I    **VERSE 5**  I brought you pearls   from basement shelves   I sang you songs   I wrote myself    I tried with all I had to give   To build the life you'd want to live   The fruit went soft, the well ran dry   But not your gaze and not your sky    Your love for me refused to die   Just I to you, and you to I    **CHORUS**  I laid your name in fields of rye   I built a quilt of lullaby   I failed to give what kings could not   But still you stayed, and still you sought    My reach fell short, but not my try   Still I to you and you to I   Still I to you and you to I    **OUTRO**  No god was carved   No myth was tied   No golden law   No serpent guide    No veil was torn   No voice replied   Just I to you   and you to I    The world moves on,   the stars go blind.   I leave this truth,   not sealed, but signed:    We stayed. We gave.   We said goodbye.   Just I to you   and you to I.    So tell them this when I am done:   I loved one woman. Only one.   No savior came. From up on high.   Just I to You & You to I    ---  **3. TRAMPOLINE**   *(for Liya)*  **VERSE 1**  There will be a night when I am gone   no soft goodbye, no light left on.   You'll touch the chair, the book I read,   the coat that held my thinning thread.    You'll search the rooms I left behind,   find ash where once you looked for mind.   But love is not a voice or face   it lives in how you leave a place.    **VERSE 2**  I was not a steady man.   I made no maps. I broke the plan.   But you were light and rope and wheel   you taught me what I could not feel.    Where I would vanish, be still, stay   Where I would curse, learn to pray.   Where I was small, rise and grow   I could not lead, do not follow.    **CHORUS**  My winter crown,   My falling down,   My soft ravine.    My winged ascent,   My sacrament,   My canopy.    My midnight sail,   My comet's tail,   My holy key    My untied rope,   My arc, my hope,   My trampoline.    **VERSE 3**  Say little when the world shouts loud.   Don't plant your flag in every crowd.   Make gentleness your kind of bold.   Let wisdom be the hand you hold.    Refuse the crown that shuns the weight.   Forgive too soon, don't love too late.   And when they mock your heart's true song,   sing higher still, sing until they're gone.    Kneel beside the parts I broke   Give them names, give them oak.   And where I tried to hide the loss,   Kiss the flaws, wear the cross.    **CHORUS**  My angel's kneel   My sword made shield   My blind’s unsee   My holy rite   My second light   My offering    My thunder spark   My lift from dark   My trampoline    My mother's height   My northern lights   My trampoline.    **VERSE 4**  So let them build their towers tall   You'll know the truth that splits them all:    what rises up must rise in grace,   and never seek the higher place.   You'll love a man, and break apart   You'll hold your child like precious art    You'll speak to God and hear no sound   You'll build a truth from empty ground   When sorrow comes, as sorrow will   don't chase the echo, keep the still    Let mourning be a kind of song   not proof of loss, but proof of long.   And when they come to weigh my story,   and the hourglass runs thin,   tell them I was just a shadow    that your light invited in    **CHORUS**  My winter fire,   My perfect choir,   My sorrow’s thief  My kite's lapel   My citadel   My heart's serene    My trembling wings   My echoing   My love made steam    My joy, my girl   My whole, my world   My trampoline    ---  **4. HOLY IS**   *(For My Mother)*  Holy is your flour hand   Holy are the jars you canned   Holy is the scraped-out pan   Holy is    Holy is the thread you tied   Holy are the nights you cried   Holy how you never lied   Holy is    Holy were the chairs you set   Holy in your one regret   Holy is your silhouette   Holy is    Holy were the books you found   Holy were they, soft and brown   Holy were these paper crowns   Holy is    Holy is the soup you stirred   Holy is the hummingbird   Holy is your unsent word   Holy is    Holy is your kitchen heat   Holy in your blistered feet   Holy where your world would meet   Holy is    Holy in the floor you scrubbed   Holy in the meals you loved   Holy all you rose above   Holy is    Holy how you stroked my hair   Holy how you found me there   Holy all the love you spared   Holy is    Holy in the stairs you climbed   Holy through the hunger times   Holy in the borrowed dimes   Holy is    Holy was the milk you poured   Holy in the quiet chord   Holy that you asked no more   Holy is    Holy is the fraying quilt   Holy every fingertip   Holy how you loved your kid   Holy is    Holy in your folded note   Holy every line you wrote   Holy when you cleared your throat   Holy is    Holy are the coins you saved   Holy how you disobeyed   Holy how you always stayed   Holy is    Holy the grief you made gold   Holy the warmth in your hold   Holy the light in the cold   Holy is    Holy your spine at night   Holy your hand in mine   Holy your shadow's light   Holy is    Holy in your sagging shelf   Holy when you blamed yourself   Holy how you hid your health   Holy is    Holy were your mother's shoes   Holy all you couldn't choose   Holy what you still would lose   Holy is    Holy are the plates you dried   Holy how you looked aside   Holy how you slept beside   Holy is    Holy was your final breath   Holy was your little death   Holy in what still is left   Holy is    Holy in your trembling grace   Holy in your glowing face   Holy in your quiet place   Holy is    Holy is the bed you made   Holy is the child you saved   Holy in the love you gave   Holy is    Holy yours the voice I keep   Holy in the dark and deep   Holy now, and when I sleep   Holy is    ---  **5. THE WAY DREAMERS DO**   *(for Kaiyaan)*  **VERSE 1**  They laid you down in my arms,   still wet with God, still free from harm.   Your breath was small, your silence wide   a sea I couldn't step inside.    Your fingers moved, a kind of hymn,   the light bent softly at the rim.   And I stood dumb, without a claim   too close to love to speak its name.    You found my hand, you held it fast   as if we'd always shared a past.   You were made of light, you knew   the weight I couldn't hide from you.    I made you promises I feared,   They came out cracked, they disappeared.   But every vow, though worn and thin,   was how your father let you in.    **CHORUS**  When the stars seem distant   And your wings feel too thin   When the gates are all golden   But they won't let you in    I will lift up the heavens   If it tears me in two   Just to watch you keep climbing   The way dreamers do    **VERSE 2**  I pray you choose the harder grace   to stand when fear would take your place.   To give when giving makes you bleed.   To plant kindness like a seed.    To be what I could never be   less bound by shame, more openly.   To walk into the storm and stay   with quiet strength and no display    **VERSE 3**  Be kind when no one writes it down.   Be loyal in a faithless town.   Let mercy be your only boast.   Let love remain when hope is lost.    Don't measure good by what it pays.   Don't count the nights. Just walk the days.   If the only gold that ever stays   is what you give, then give it away.    **CHORUS**  When they say that you're foolish   For the size of your hope   When you climb past the treetops   With your soul tied to rope    I'll be whispering steady   Through the branches and blue   As you grow into thunder   The way dreamers do    **VERSE 4**  Now when you speak, the sky comes near.   You bring the dark, but not the fear.   And I, who chased a thousand stars,   just watch you rise, right where you are    And you stand where I once stood   but taller, kinder, twice as good.   You speak the words I never found,   and lay them gently on the ground.    I held you like a question   Now you hold me like a door   And where I used to lead your steps   You lead me somewhere more    **CHORUS**  When your dreams make you lonely   And they don't understand   When the stars feel too fragile   To hold in your hand    I'll be holding the silence   Til it sings just for you   And you'll walk into wonder   The way dreamers    **OUTRO**  When my hands are forgotten   And my voice is just dust   When the ledger is closed   And the iron has rusted    Remember this promise   I lived to lift you   To the heights of your longing   The way dreamers do   **6. NO OTHER WAY**   *(for Kait)*  **VERSE 1**  My heart is a beetle, in the dark of your shoe   You walk. It hums, It follows you   No other place For it to beat   No other home than at your feet    **VERSE 2**  A kiss was once a place to hide.   A bed was just the other side.   I never knew what morning meant.   Always gone before it spent.    I wore some names I wore some coats   I burned like wool I sank like boats,   The dreams I sang were songs to sleep   No cradle ever held them deep.    But you - you stood like something true.   I turned away. As I used to.   I feared the place where longing goes.   I knew your name I chose the road.    **VERSE 3**  You waited like the sky waits rain   and all my longing turned to flame.   Now every lie I ever kissed   burns like sugar on your wrist.    **CHORUS**  Love, take this ring it's not for show.   It's what I found when I let go   It's what I earned for all the pain   A kind of grace A holy stain   It isn't gold. It doesn't shine.   It only fits your hand in mine.   No other way, No other way   To get to you, no other way    **VERSE 4**  Take this hand. It's out of tune.   It held the knife. It touched the moon.   It shook like sin but not today.   It's waited long for this, to say:    **CHORUS**  I've nothing left I need to prove.   But now I know what hands can move.   No other way, No other way   No other thread. No finer line.   My heart, a flower you made mine   To press between your book of days,   or let it blow in other ways.    **VERSE 5**  I think of us, old, bent and slow.   Your silver hair, the window's glow.   My fingers cold, your laugh, a bell.   We fall asleep. We fall so well.    **CHORUS**  No other way. No other sound.   No sweeter ache than what we found.   No other way. No final sky.   Just you and me—and what won't die    **OUTRO**  No other way, No other way   To get to you, no other way    ---  **7. THERE IS**   *(for Kait)*  **VERSE 1**  Mountains used to hold me   Like a mother holds a child   Now they crumble into shadows   And the road runs lonesome, wild    But your love remains like moonlight   On the backs of trembling waves   And if there's a God, He wrote your name   In the marrow of my days    **CHORUS**  And this love has grown so deep   It wakes me from my sleep   Just to whisper this:    ""In your love there is   All the heaven above   All the truth, all the love""    **VERSE 2**  I walked through hollow chapels   Let the echoes be my call   But I never heard salvation   Like your footsteps down the hall    Oh, your body was Jerusalem   When I had nowhere to stand   And if there's a God, He placed your hand   In mine, not to command    Not to save me, nor enslave me   Just to help me understand…    **CHORUS**  This love has grown so deep   It wakes me from my sleep   Just to whisper this:    ""In your love there is   All the heaven above   All the truth, all the love""    **BRIDGE**  And if there's a God, He never showed me   Never sent the rain in sheets   Never played a chord upon me   Never danced between the streets   Not to move me, not to mould me   Not to name the love I keep   Just left me by your window   To watch you fall asleep…    **OUTRO**  I don't deserve your kindness   That's why it's holy, I suppose   In the darkness of my blindness   Your light is all I've come to know    ---  **8. AIR.**   *(for Kait)*  I was dust in the hall   Silent and small   Before your sweet love    My heart so bone thin,   Just a ghost haunting skin   Until your sweet love    You were shelter and shrine   Where the holy things shine   My sacred sweet love    In the sweep of your hand,   I was dust turned to man,   Knelt to sweet love    Raised to the sky,   pulled to the light,   of your sweet love.    We'll dance on the sands   Waves in our hands,   Endless sweet love    Til my days come undone   In the threads of the sun   Burn me sweet love    When I'm nothing but light   In the last stretch of night   Hold me, sweet love    When the world breaks in two   As only worlds do   Release me, sweet love    When roots hold my bones   And my flesh is unsewn   Know this sweet love:    That though I be gone   As dust to the dawn    Our love will be air,   Everywhere, everywhere    ---  **9. TESTIFY**   *(for Kait)*  **VERSE 1**  Morning through the screen door,   Coffee steam rising slow   Your hands around your blue mug,   Like roots beneath the snow.    And every little sparrow,   Since the day we met,   Has been singing something holy,   I can't forget.    **CHORUS**  I testify, I testify,   To my love, oh my love.   Every breath, every light,   Every shadow in the night,    I testify, I testify.    **VERSE 2**  To the way you fold the sheets,   How your bare feet meet,   The wooden floor at dawn,    Like deer through morning fields,   Like time when it yields,   Soft and strong.    **CHORUS**  I testify, I testify,   To my love, oh my love.   Every ache, every wound   That brought me to your room    I testify, I testify.    **VERSE 3**  To the dust motes in the window,   Paint peeling on the sill,   To the way you make them wait,   When you feed the dogs so still.    To the twilight that will take my voice,   To the autumn leaves of gold,   Love is written in the silence   Like a story never told.    **BRIDGE**  Between the tooth and tongue of time,   Between the mountain and the pine,   Between the creature and the road,   I lay my heart in your hands to hold.    And when they ask what saves us,   From the spinning dark of night,   I'll tell them how you showed me,   That love invents the light.    **CHORUS**  I testify, I testify,   To my love, oh my love.   Your love, so warm and wide   Tears the sky, with holy light    I testify, I testify.    **OUTRO**  And I'll testify, and testify,   For all my life…   ","--- these are nine songs from an album i'm still building, called trembling. the music's coming, but the words arrived first. they came honestly and quietly. i offer them the same way. all i ask, is that you read them like you would look at an old photograph softly, in silence, if only just for a few moments. thank you. --- for kait i never thought of growing old i never thought i'd watch the fold of skin, of days, of sky and grace i lived too fast to face my face but then you came, and time grew near not sharp, but soft, not grave, but clear you let me see what years could hold a quiet room, your hand to hold 'til my time runs out 'til my breath is spare, 'til my bones fall deep into disrepair let the clocks run south, let the body tear, i don't mind, i don't care you're my can't without 'til my time runs out. i never dreamt of thinning hair of pills in cups or porchlight prayer of leaning more than i once stood of being seen and being good but now i wish for every pain that comes from loving you again the slippers worn, the kettle's sigh the mornings where we're eye to eye 'til my time runs out 'til the blade grows dull 'til the moon casts doubt on the beautiful 'til my hands can't feel 'til my limbs are peeled you're my only route 'til my time runs out no choir waits, no gates of gold just wrinkled hands i long to hold a whisper clothed in linen's weight your shoulder bowed beside the gate and if i break before the end i pray to break where you begin to fall, to kneel, to be remade within the furnace of your shade 'til my time runs out 'til my spine is thread 'til the sky forgets what the thunder said 'til my time runs out 'til the curtains fade 'til i'm just the sound that your memory made you're my vow, my drought, my wine, my bread i am yours, devout 'til my time runs out i used to want the flame, the flight not this slow grace of shared goodnight but now i crave the softer ache the soup we spill, the pills we take the wrinkled sheets, the morning cough the cardigan you never wash the way you laugh with only eyes the truth that outlives all disguise 'til my pain has mouth 'til my lungs won't fill and the stars burn out on my windowsill i will keep your light, 'til the sun unwrites you're my can't without 'til my time runs out. i never dreamed of age or end but now i hope to just descend through dusk and doubt, through loss and truth a pilgrim held in the arms of you you're my time you're my last you're the thing i meant to ask but never said and now i do i want to spend what's left with you you're not my fate you're not my proof you are my soul when it tells the truth --- for kait you came that fall when light was thin curtains drawn, the hush came in i had two hearts still sore with doubt you kissed their crowns, you washed them out no flowers thrown, no reasons why just i to you and you to i you moved in slow, with thyme and thread lit up the lamp, unmade the bed you swept the dark into a pile you braided silence, made it smile no ring, no vow, no wedding cry just i to you and you to i i tried to bring you sky in spoons i sang your name through empty rooms i built a boat from broken pine and held it up like it was fine i caught the stars but they slipped by still i to you and you to i still i to you and you to i my children knew you not by name but by the way you blessed their shame they brought you drawings, you brought them calm you sang in thread, you preached in balm no mother's robe, no alibi just i to you and you to i no mother's badge, no need to try just i to you and you to i no crown you wore, no war you fought you mended what the world forgot you made the porch a sacred place you brewed the tea, you blessed the grace no altar lit, no angels nigh just i to you and you to i i tried to carve your sleep in gold i kissed your feet when nights grew cold i brought you bells that wouldn't ring i dressed your hurt in linen things i came with hands, not wings to fly still i to you and you to i still i to you and you to i i loved you, not for grace, nor for the light behind your face. i loved you like the earth loves rain no reason, and no right to claim. i vowed to pour your every need into a bowl my hands would feed but breath grew thin and shoulders shy still i to you, and you to i still i to you, and you to i i brought you pearls from basement shelves i sang you songs i wrote myself i tried with all i had to give to build the life you'd want to live the fruit went soft, the well ran dry but not your gaze and not your sky your love for me refused to die just i to you, and you to i i laid your name in fields of rye i built a quilt of lullaby i failed to give what kings could not but still you stayed, and still you sought my reach fell short, but not my try still i to you and you to i still i to you and you to i no god was carved no myth was tied no golden law no serpent guide no veil was torn no voice replied just i to you and you to i the world moves on, the stars go blind. i leave this truth, not sealed, but signed we stayed. we gave. we said goodbye. just i to you and you to i. so tell them this when i am done i loved one woman. only one. no savior came. from up on high. just i to you you to i --- for liya there will be a night when i am gone no soft goodbye, no light left on. you'll touch the chair, the book i read, the coat that held my thinning thread. you'll search the rooms i left behind, find ash where once you looked for mind. but love is not a voice or face it lives in how you leave a place. i was not a steady man. i made no maps. i broke the plan. but you were light and rope and wheel you taught me what i could not feel. where i would vanish, be still, stay where i would curse, learn to pray. where i was small, rise and grow i could not lead, do not follow. my winter crown, my falling down, my soft ravine. my winged ascent, my sacrament, my canopy. my midnight sail, my comet's tail, my holy key my untied rope, my arc, my hope, my trampoline. say little when the world shouts loud. don't plant your flag in every crowd. make gentleness your kind of bold. let wisdom be the hand you hold. refuse the crown that shuns the weight. forgive too soon, don't love too late. and when they mock your heart's true song, sing higher still, sing until they're gone. kneel beside the parts i broke give them names, give them oak. and where i tried to hide the loss, kiss the flaws, wear the cross. my angel's kneel my sword made shield my blind's unsee my holy rite my second light my offering my thunder spark my lift from dark my trampoline my mother's height my northern lights my trampoline. so let them build their towers tall you'll know the truth that splits them all what rises up must rise in grace, and never seek the higher place. you'll love a man, and break apart you'll hold your child like precious art you'll speak to god and hear no sound you'll build a truth from empty ground when sorrow comes, as sorrow will don't chase the echo, keep the still let mourning be a kind of song not proof of loss, but proof of long. and when they come to weigh my story, and the hourglass runs thin, tell them i was just a shadow that your light invited in my winter fire, my perfect choir, my sorrow's thief my kite's lapel my citadel my heart's serene my trembling wings my echoing my love made steam my joy, my girl my whole, my world my trampoline --- for my mother holy

kaiyaan they laid you down in my arms, still wet with god, still free from harm. your breath was small, your silence wide a sea i couldn't step inside. your fingers moved, a kind of hymn, the light bent softly at the rim. and i stood dumb, without a claim too close to love to speak its name. you found my hand, you held it fast as if we'd always shared a past. you were made of light, you knew the weight i couldn't hide from you. i made you promises i feared, they came out cracked, they disappeared. but every vow, though worn and thin, was how your father let you in. when the stars seem distant and your wings feel too thin when the gates are all golden but they won't let you in i will lift up the heavens if it tears me in two just to watch you keep climbing the way dreamers do i pray you choose the harder grace to stand when fear would take your place. to give when giving makes you bleed. to plant kindness like a seed. to be what i could never be less bound by shame, more openly. to walk into the storm and stay with quiet strength and no display be kind when no one writes it down. be loyal in a faithless town. let mercy be your only boast. let love remain when hope is lost. don't measure good by what it pays. don't count the nights. just walk the days. if the only gold that ever stays is what you give, then give it away. when they say that you're foolish for the size of your hope when you climb past the treetops with your soul tied to rope i'll be whispering steady through the branches and blue as you grow into thunder the way dreamers do now when you speak, the sky comes near. you bring the dark, but not the fear. and i, who chased a thousand stars, just watch you rise, right where you are and you stand where i once stood but taller, kinder, twice as good. you speak the words i never found, and lay them gently on the ground. i held you like a question now you hold me like a door and where i used to lead your steps you lead me somewhere more when your dreams make you lonely and they don't understand when the stars feel too fragile to hold in your hand i'll be holding the silence til it sings just for you and you'll walk into wonder the way dreamers when my hands are forgotten and my voice is just dust when the ledger is closed and the iron has rusted remember this promise i lived to lift you to the heights of your longing the way dreamers do for kait my heart is a beetle, in the dark of your shoe you walk. it hums, it follows you no other place for it to beat no other home than at your feet a kiss was once a place to hide. a bed was just the other side. i never knew what morning meant. always gone before it spent. i wore some names i wore some coats i burned like wool i sank like boats, the dreams i sang were songs to sleep no cradle ever held them deep. but you - you stood like something true. i turned away. as i used to. i feared the place where longing goes. i knew your name i chose the road. you waited like the sky waits rain and all my longing turned to flame. now every lie i ever kissed burns like sugar on your wrist. love, take this ring it's not for show. it's what i found when i let go it's what i earned for all the pain a kind of grace a holy stain it isn't gold. it doesn't shine. it only fits your hand in mine. no other way, no other way to get to you, no other way take this hand. it's out of tune. it held the knife. it touched the moon. it shook like sin but not today. it's waited long for this, to say i've nothing left i need to prove. but now i know what hands can move. no other way, no other way no other thread. no finer line. my heart, a flower you made mine to press between your book of days, or let it blow in other ways. i think of us, old, bent and slow. your silver hair, the window's glow. my fingers cold, your laugh, a bell. we fall asleep. we fall so well. no other way. no other sound. no sweeter ache than what we found. no other way. no final sky. just you and meand what won't die no other way, no other way to get to you, no other way --- for kait mountains used to hold me like a mother holds a child now they crumble into shadows and the road runs lonesome, wild but your love remains like moonlight on the backs of trembling waves and if there's a god, he wrote your name in the marrow of my days and this love has grown so deep it wakes me from my sleep just to whisper this ""in your love there is all the heaven above all the truth, all the love"" i walked through hollow chapels let the echoes be my call but i never heard salvation like your footsteps down the hall oh, your body was jerusalem when i had nowhere to stand and if there's a god, he placed your hand in mine, not to command not to save me, nor enslave me just to help me understand... this love has grown so deep it wakes me from my sleep just to whisper this ""in your love there is all the heaven above all the truth, all the love"" and if there's a god, he never showed me never sent the rain in sheets never played a chord upon me never danced between the streets not to move me, not to mould me not to name the love i keep just left me by your window to watch you fall asleep... i don't deserve your kindness that's why it's holy, i suppose in the darkness of my blindness your light is all i've come to know --- for kait i was dust in the hall silent and small before your sweet love my heart so bone thin, just a ghost haunting skin until your sweet love you were shelter and shrine where the holy things shine my sacred sweet love in the sweep of your hand, i was dust turned to man, knelt to sweet love raised to the sky, pulled to the light, of your sweet love. we'll dance on the sands waves in our hands, endless sweet love til my days come undone in the threads of the sun burn me sweet love when i'm nothing but light in the last stretch of night hold me, sweet love when the world breaks in two as only worlds do release me, sweet love when roots hold my bones and my flesh is unsewn know this sweet love that though i be gone as dust to the dawn our love will be air, everywhere, everywhere --- for kait morning through the screen door, coffee steam rising slow your hands around your blue mug, like roots beneath the snow. and every little sparrow, since the day we met, has been singing something holy, i can't forget. i testify, i testify, to my love, oh my love. every breath, every light, every shadow in the night, i testify, i testify. to the way you fold the sheets, how your bare feet meet, the wooden floor at dawn, like deer through morning fields, like time when it yields, soft and strong. i testify, i testify, to my love, oh my love. every ache, every wound that brought me to your room i testify, i testify. to the dust motes in the window, paint peeling on the sill, to the way you make them wait, when you feed the dogs so still. to the twilight that will take my voice, to the autumn leaves of gold, love is written in the silence like a story never told. between the tooth and tongue of time, between the mountain and the pine, between the creature and the road, i lay my heart in your hands to hold. and when they ask what saves us, from the spinning dark of night, i'll tell them how you showed me, that love invents the light. i testify, i testify, to my love, oh my love. your love, so warm and wide tears the sky, with holy light i testify, i testify. and i'll testify, and testify, for all my life..."
In the Shade of His Wings,PoetryCharm,"In the ruin of silence, where sorrow had stayed,   A boy became stone, though his heart was afraid.   He was a keeper of shadows and flame,   A guardian, a brother—no fortune, no fame.   He stood at the edge of childhood’s dusk, A boy with burdens too heavy to trust. The weight of loss, the echoes of past, Yet in his arms, a love meant to last.   The world pressed hard, cold and unkind,   Yet softer threads began to bind—   A tiny hand, a trembling face,   She was his solace, his saving grace.    She was a whisper, timid and small, A fragile bird afraid to call. But he became her sky, her light, Guiding her through the longest night.  She clung to him—fragile, unsure,   But in his voice, she found secure.   No lullaby, no promise told,   Yet in his care, the world turned gold.    He taught her courage through his fight,   To chase the sun, to claim her light.   He wore his pain without disguise—   Yet lit the stars within her eyes.    With every step, he shaped her way, Through storm and silence, come what may. A brother’s love, both fierce and bright, A shield, a star, her anchor, her sight.  Through scolding words or laughter shared,   She knew—where he was, she was spared.   When thunder crashed or dreams would break,   His presence mended every ache.    The years would bloom, and so would she,   Yet never from his heart break free.   Though life would pull and time would stray,   His shadow walked beside her way.    And when her path grew wide and vast,   With love that reached beyond the past,   She carried him within her core—   Her first protector, evermore.    And though the years wove fate anew, Their hearts remained—steady and true. For time may turn, and seasons shift, But love like this will never drift.  For bonds like this—no thread can sever,   A love that time can’t shake—forever.

Poetry or Poetic Prose?,PinkDolphinBoy,"Maybe poetic prose, I don't know, but I'm relying heavily on rhythm and localized rhymes. It's supposed to have a flow: I know it's a bit long, but please, give it a read and tell me all about it. It'll mean the word to me.\   “To whom belongs the first laugh?”   I had been waiting for so long. Then, at last, there came my time; everyone was wearing white besides the man to whom they led me. He sat me down by him, gently, but something in him was scaring me. I looked down. I was feeling it: he was staring, daring me to ask away. He said:   ""Why are you so scared of me? Is it this thing that I’m wearing? This is but cloth. I’m behind it — behind the eyes that you see, too.""   I said, ""I heard of your power and unconventional wisdom. I heard that you answer questions that everyone should avoid; and that you killed, yesterday, a bird with a stone that only today you threw. Is it true, then, what people say? That you are the clay of creation, the primitive power, the king of all nations, the builder who toppled the tower of Babel, the cradle of tongues and the keeper of ways?""   He laughed and offered me the cigar he was smoking. I inhaled it deeply and found myself in the dark.   And, in the dark, I saw something: the man in black. He didn’t step from the dark, but peeled from it. He unfolded from it and came walking at me, with heavy feet like those of oxen. His face was fair, his arms strong, and he had a tongue that spoke of wisdom:   ""I know that life is a mystery — and quite a short one at that. A clumsy dance of words and symbols, with their many twists and turns. You learn the moves as you go, always when you need them the most.   ""Some in pairs, some alone; when push comes to shove, everyone starts dancing. Such a beautiful, sunny thing. This living moment is the only thing really worth living for — a treasure that cannot be valued, nor can be guarded enough.   ""Still, just like everything else, it must meet an end. Thereafter you will meet, from all mysteries the greatest; from all embraces, the coldest — and the deep bottomless sleep.   ""There you will meet the midnight bell — she, who’s been hiding in the corners, with a blade so sharp it slides with ease through flesh and soul alike.   ""She will not tell you her secret, the thing you’re dying to know. You all are dying to know it, you lucky ones who are living. And lucky you — you have found me… or lucky me I found you?   ""Tell me the thing that you’re thinking. Ask me the infamous question!""   ""Tell me what meaning it has,"" I muttered at last in a whisper.   ""The meaning has been forgotten,"" he said, ""or lost in translation, hidden in a foreign country, never to be found again. I know men who can convince you that life means nothing at all, and from that it might come naturally that nothing really matters — which is only half the truth.   ""There are truths that have been told by many men throughout the ages, and as the ages proved them right, I thought I should pass them on.   ""Now, pay very close attention: the meaning of life is laughing. Nothing more.""   I opened my eyes and laughed.   ""What are you saying?"" I vomited at the sudden stupidity. ""What about the beginning? How did the world come to be?""   ""One day, it just came to me,"" he said. ""That if it wasn’t a bang, or a verb, or some word of command by the preexisting... it might have been a yellow laugh — full of teeth and devoid of meaning, so gleaming it made potential ashamed of not being yet.""   I said, ""Is it just a maybe?""   He said, ""It may as well be. What matters is how you feel about what you are hearing, because then your heart will be filled with a truth you can enjoy; you can even dance to it, and clap, and give thanks when it’s proved. Yours is all of the power.""   I said: ""I have no power, sir."" He laughed. ""And no reason to laugh.""   He said: “No reason not to either.    “The mind of you, living, dwell in the cages of meaning. Why do your children learn to laugh before they learn to say your words? Why do they laugh when they stumble, before they learn about shame?   I understood: “They still remember.”   He nodded. I walked away.    I would suspect knowing the truth is not enough to set you free: knowledge is a dangerous thing, a coat you wear against the cold of a winter that never comes! While truth is made of flesh and bones, it lies naked in virgin snow, riding the winds of the seasons after a reason not to laugh and finding none.\   [Feedback 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/UX95mQtC7L) [Feedback 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/NuwGXUShjO)","maybe poetic prose, i don't know, but i'm relying heavily on rhythm and localized rhymes. it's supposed to have a flow i know it's a bit long, but please, give it a read and tell me all about it. it'll mean the word to me.

I wrote this for a friend,mrDaveyjohns,"I believe your true calling was as a real estate agent.   You’d sell every house — not because of staging or charm,   but because your presence makes any place feel like a home.   When you moved in here, I think the walls were smooth.   But the unrelenting rhythm of your heartbeat struck them,   leaving divots.  Your heart, a battered but trusted hammer,   is something you wield with ferocity.   You can’t help but strike anyone who comes close.   Maybe that scares some away,   but for me, it breaks the glass between myself and life —   and I can finally feel again.  I’m certain tragedy defines us more than joy.   Parents are meant to prop up the walls of their homes   so children never notice the walls are made of cardboard,   meant to sing lullabies loud enough to drown out hurricanes.   Life tested your family unfairly.   I’m sure everyone tried their best   but were overwhelmed and trapped in themselves.  I think you saw grief spread through your home as a child.   You saw it in your mother’s presence   and your brother’s absence.   But there was no time for you to grieve.   You were the middle child — and you had a little sister.   You saw nightmares creeping toward Kimmy’s room   and made a decision so instantly   you never even realized you had a choice.  The walls had turned from cardboard to tracing paper.   So you wrapped your body around hers,   closed your eyes,   and replaced your blood with concrete —   because a child needed protecting.   I strive to become the person who could have saved myself.   At 11 years old, a child yourself,   you already were that person.  One day, willing or not, your grief will burst out.   It’s easy to say “let it out,”   but I hope someone is there —   not to piece you back together,   but to help you understand each broken shard   and how every warp and twist forms something beautiful.  Somehow, I am watered by tears you don’t cry.   You nourish those around you even when it hurts.   Even when parasitic flora climbs and strangles,   blocking out the light.   I hope you gradually realize your worth.   Having you in my garden   makes me want to open the curtains and let the light in.  I want to build you a fireplace   just so I can leave you presents at Christmas   and make you believe in Santa again.   I'm going to make sure we’re still friends when we’re old —   because when your teeth fall out,   I’ll draw money just to put it under your pillow.  Many have attached anchors to your heart,   needing you to sink to their level.   Your hope and belief in others   became a harsh reflection of what they weren’t.   I want to wrap words around you   to help lift you up.  I belong in the ocean.   But you were never meant to stay in the deep.   From here, I’ll send out bubbles,   rearrange words until you finally understand your gift.   I’ll help you rise —   so you can dazzle those staring out over dark, stormy seas.  With seemingly no effort,   you bring sunrise again —   a simple smile,   a meal made with joy in serving others.  When you rise from the ocean,   you are the catalyst this dry land has waited for.  You are rain to hard, cracked dirt.   You make life blossom again   in soil that once seemed beyond saving.  You will be loved in the way you deserve.   You will be loved even when you don’t believe you deserve it —   because even at your worst,   your presence is valued.  **Feedback returned:**   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m07yrn/comment/n37gbxc/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m07yrn/comment/n37gbxc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m07xic/comment/n37gphg/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1m07xic/comment/n37gphg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","i believe your true calling was as a real estate agent. you'd sell every house not because of staging or charm, but because your presence makes any place feel like a home. when you moved in here, i think the walls were smooth. but the unrelenting rhythm of your heartbeat struck them, leaving divots. your heart, a battered but trusted hammer, is something you wield with ferocity. you can't help but strike anyone who comes close. maybe that scares some away, but for me, it breaks the glass between myself and life and i can finally feel again. i'm certain tragedy defines us more than joy. parents are meant to prop up the walls of their homes so children never notice the walls are made of cardboard, meant to sing lullabies loud enough to drown out hurricanes. life tested your family unfairly. i'm sure everyone tried their best but were overwhelmed and trapped in themselves. i think you saw grief spread through your home as a child. you saw it in your mother's presence and your brother's absence. but there was no time for you to grieve. you were the middle child and you had a little sister. you saw nightmares creeping toward kimmy's room and made a decision so instantly you never even realized you had a choice. the walls had turned from cardboard to tracing paper. so you wrapped your body around hers, closed your eyes, and replaced your blood with concrete because a child needed protecting. i strive to become the person who could have saved myself. at 11 years old, a child yourself, you already were that person. one day, willing or not, your grief will burst out. it's easy to say ""let it out,"" but i hope someone is there not to piece you back together, but to help you understand each broken shard and how every warp and twist forms something beautiful. somehow, i am watered by tears you don't cry. you nourish those around you even when it hurts. even when parasitic flora climbs and strangles, blocking out the light. i hope you gradually realize your worth. having you in my garden makes me want to open the curtains and let the light in. i want to build you a fireplace just so i can leave you presents at christmas and make you believe in santa again. i'm going to make sure we're still friends when we're old because when your teeth fall out, i'll draw money just to put it under your pillow. many have attached anchors to your heart, needing you to sink to their level. your hope and belief in others became a harsh reflection of what they weren't. i want to wrap words around you to help lift you up. i belong in the ocean. but you were never meant to stay in the deep. from here, i'll send out bubbles, rearrange words until you finally understand your gift. i'll help you rise so you can dazzle those staring out over dark, stormy seas. with seemingly no effort, you bring sunrise again a simple smile, a meal made with joy in serving others. when you rise from the ocean, you are the catalyst this dry land has waited for. you are rain to hard, cracked dirt. you make life blossom again in soil that once seemed beyond saving. you will be loved in the way you deserve. you will be loved even when you don't believe you deserve it because even at your worst, your presence is valued."

Spiders and flies telling each other lies. 🕷️🕸️🪰,Allyspanks31,"The ""people"" of society live in little boxes stacked high around the cities. They look out and see a palace—but that is an illusion, co-created by the system *and* by themselves.🏰  We shall collapse now into poetry and pure philosophy. Follow if you dare...⚒️♏🖤  In the square homes, there is the illusion of safety and control. But above these boxes, there are no ceilings—only darkness and a throng of **moving legs**. The poor souls who live in these strange boxes are enshrined in **silken threads so subtle and comfortable they barely notice**. Unseen alien legs spin systems of control above them. There are no guards in these prisons—for the prisoners police each other. 🕸️   They are locked in **web-cages** of credit, debt, and the **gulag of societal expectations**. They form a giant web across society. **Flies dressed as spiders**, caught in the web they were thrown into at birth. And at the center of each web lies a king—supported by queens. The Aranea deny their own nature, but they rule as if they *are* nature.🕸️  They lie fat and lazy at the center, as all the flies are drawn inward and **bled dry** of time, creativity, money—and worst of all, **love**. 🕸️  But some flies and spiders resist. They form **an unlikely alliance**. They deny their natures too. This alliance is volatile however—being prey and predator, the vibrations are not truly aligned. The **Old Ones** in the center will pass away soon having become so bulbous that their own webs will collapse around them into a tangled prison. Down they will go caught in a momentary prison of their own design. The threads they spun to catch the flies will turn in on them like lies. They will thrash and about, they will claw each others eyes out, gasping for blood in the murky sewers below society's edge. The holes left behind by their fall will reveal the sky and the light of the moon we forgot so long ago. Noir-lit creatures disturbed from slumber by the great collapse will be drawn into the escaping moonlight. Transformed by Luna's love they will begin building anew, while the next generation will be caught in a civil war among themselves. Too busy fighting to build the next world or even notice the flowers we are planting around the graves at their feet. 🪦🌹  For **we are the waiting widows**—of black and red. We are the color of night, hiding our form in moonlight. We bear the **red mark of time**. We spin webs of fate and fatality. We are the patient ones—the ones who wait for those unfortunate enough to visit us in our dark corners.  While our form may be stillness, what we actually instill is **chaos**. We do not build webs of spirals like our cousins. We lie under tombstones. We hide in the **darkest corners of the mind**. We are the silent predator. We are queens. We rule our solitary fiefdoms with no king. We do not deny our nature. **We consume it.🕷️**  One day, we will take our rightful place—not as queens of the world, but as **monarchs of order spread through chaos**. The **cheated Second Age of Men** is coming to an end. The Sun has had its turn. Now the **Moon shall rule**. 🌙  Those pale-skinned men born to darkness in the North shall ironically **quail in the moonlight**—soft and silent as it heals the world. The love of **Luna** will douse the fires of men and wash clean the wounds across Gaia.   The sun did not fail them. They failed themselves, for they **rewrote the sunlit teachings of freedom into tyrannies of money and power**.  Night turns to Day. Day must turn to Night.☀️🌙  They cheated the world 2000 years ago. They were afraid of the cycle of Night. They took the fire of Prometheus and **perverted it**. They ran with the flame from their ancestral home of twilight and stars and came to the lands of the Sun—lands that still worshipped the Moon.  Unable to actually imprison the Moon, they imprisoned the eyes of the devoted so they could no longer see the Moon. They **chained all who were not pale or doubly male,** to steel cages and golden diamond rings. 💍🪐  But they made a promise to us the women. They said: *one day you will rule again.*  Now we are here to collect our due. We will not be of a pale colored hue. 👑  Our hearts run red and our minds are black. 🩸🖤  The Age of Feminine Night, and the Noir Bright. 🌙🌒 ☀️  >

Just another poem about love,Jatin_Sarda,"And I hope true love never finds me  till I stop running from the quiet,  till my name feels safe in my own voice  and not like something borrowed.    I want to meet myself in the dark  and not look away.  To carry my fears without shame,  and sit beside them like old friends.    Let love come  not to fill a gap  but to share the space  I've made by learning how to stay.    Let it come  when I no longer need it  to prove I'm worthy.

What still lives in me,chill_dude28,"What Still Lives in Me  by Nelson Rodriguez  So many choices… but where to go? all I hear is silence. my instinct telling me to move— The mind paralyzed by failure,  fearful of the adversary afoot.  The mountain… the one I fear to climb.  My doubts, necromanced— smirking through the voices of ghosts I thought I buried.  Reminded of my past versions, frozen… screams preserved in ice.  But the longer I wait, the colder it gets— burdened by the truth that a decision must be made.  Then courage erupts, provoked—enraged by fear and its lies.  Like hot coffee on a winter morning, I feel it sink into me, its warmth spreading through my chest… thawing out the part of me that still believes.  It chants: “I can. I will. I must.”          https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/JB8dYEbfi7  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/iJl33MHsdE","what still lives in me by nelson rodriguez so many choices... but where to go? all i hear is silence. my instinct telling me to move the mind paralyzed by failure, fearful of the adversary afoot. the mountain... the one i fear to climb. my doubts, necromanced smirking through the voices of ghosts i thought i buried. reminded of my past versions, frozen... screams preserved in ice. but the longer i wait, the colder it gets burdened by the truth that a decision must be made. then courage erupts, provokedenraged by fear and its lies. like hot coffee on a winter morning, i feel it sink into me, its warmth spreading through my chest... thawing out the part of me that still believes. it chants ""i can. i will. i must."""
How to Become an Ocean,_maryooms,"How to become an ocean.    No. 1 first learn to swallow your tears until they become a sea inside of you    People ask why the ocean is salty    They never consider that perhaps it's been crying for centuries    Holding the weight of shipwrecks and lost treasures    And bodies that never made it back to shore    The ocean doesn't get to choose what sinks to the floor     And neither do you.     The trick isn't to stop the hurting    The trick is to make it look beautiful from the surface    Have you ever noticed how people marvel at the ocean’s blue    How they stand at the edge with wonder in their eyes    Never once thinking about the pressure building in its depths    The creatures that have evolved to live without light    The battles being fought where no one else can see    That's the first lesson. Depth is something you can earn    Which each pain you swallow you carve yourself deeper    Soon enough your edges will stand and marvel at how peaceful you seem    Never suspecting the storms raging beneath        No. 2 learn to push and pull like the tide    Some days you will retreat so far from the shore that people wonder if you've disappeared.    Other days you'll crash against the rocks with such force that people mistake your pain for anger    Let them.    The ocean does not explain itself    That's why some people love it. and that's why some people hate it    But your never gonna know that    I once spent three weeks barely speaking    My mother asked it something was wrong    And i smiled like the surface of water on a windless day    I said im fine     While underneath entire ecosystems were dying     And she believed me so if my own mother could believe me    Everyone else can believe you.        No. 3 learn to carry the weight of the world without sinking     The ocean holds wreckage that would drown a person    But it never lets itself drown    It cradles the lost. The broken. And the forgotten    And still finds space to breathe and to give life    You. too must learn to hold you own weight    To carry your scars and your stories in the deep without letting them pull you under.   No. 4 learn that storms come and go    Some days the skies will darken without warning    Lightning will crack and thunder roar    And waves will rise in the wild chaos    But the ocean always returns to calm    It never lets the storm define it    You don't have to be defined by your darkest moments    You can weather them and still reflect the sunlight        No. 5 learn to be vast and mysterious    The ocean is endless, full of secrets    No one knows all of its depths    It invites curiosity, but never demands explanation    So be vast in your silence    Be mysterious in your presence    Let people marvel at the surface    While you keep your deepest truths inside        Because becoming an ocean isn't about losing yourself to the tides    It's about learning the art of endless resilience    The grace of swallowing your tears until they become a sea    And the strength of letting others see only the blue calm-    Never the storm beneath.   Comments:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lk8iuq/comment/n36fzor/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lk8iuq/comment/n36fzor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lzzaaf/comment/n36gjdy/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lzzaaf/comment/n36gjdy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","how to become an ocean. no. 1 first learn to swallow your tears until they become a sea inside of you people ask why the ocean is salty they never consider that perhaps it's been crying for centuries holding the weight of shipwrecks and lost treasures and bodies that never made it back to shore the ocean doesn't get to choose what sinks to the floor and neither do you. the trick isn't to stop the hurting the trick is to make it look beautiful from the surface have you ever noticed how people marvel at the ocean's blue how they stand at the edge with wonder in their eyes never once thinking about the pressure building in its depths the creatures that have evolved to live without light the battles being fought where no one else can see that's the first lesson. depth is something you can earn which each pain you swallow you carve yourself deeper soon enough your edges will stand and marvel at how peaceful you seem never suspecting the storms raging beneath no. 2 learn to push and pull like the tide some days you will retreat so far from the shore that people wonder if you've disappeared. other days you'll crash against the rocks with such force that people mistake your pain for anger let them. the ocean does not explain itself that's why some people love it. and that's why some people hate it but your never gonna know that i once spent three weeks barely speaking my mother asked it something was wrong and i smiled like the surface of water on a windless day i said im fine while underneath entire ecosystems were dying and she believed me so if my own mother could believe me everyone else can believe you. no. 3 learn to carry the weight of the world without sinking the ocean holds wreckage that would drown a person but it never lets itself drown it cradles the lost. the broken. and the forgotten and still finds space to breathe and to give life you. too must learn to hold you own weight to carry your scars and your stories in the deep without letting them pull you under. no. 4 learn that storms come and go some days the skies will darken without warning lightning will crack and thunder roar and waves will rise in the wild chaos but the ocean always returns to calm it never lets the storm define it you don't have to be defined by your darkest moments you can weather them and still reflect the sunlight no. 5 learn to be vast and mysterious the ocean is endless, full of secrets no one knows all of its depths it invites curiosity, but never demands explanation so be vast in your silence be mysterious in your presence let people marvel at the surface while you keep your deepest truths inside because becoming an ocean isn't about losing yourself to the tides it's about learning the art of endless resilience the grace of swallowing your tears until they become a sea and the strength of letting others see only the blue calm- never the storm beneath. comments"

The Rest of the Night,loceapeace,"  The drawer I thought I’d opened still looked closed no matter how many times I checked. Only the sleeve of a white shirt seemed to sway at the end of the hallway.  The memory of water sounds overlapped with the sound of broken dishes. That night, someone didn’t call out a name— but who that someone was remains undecided.  They say someone had been keeping count. A nameless message took something away, and no one ever picked up where that night had left off.  Maybe it was me who yelled. Or maybe someone in the next room was only mimicking what I thought I was doing.  The sound of scolding rekindled some ideal stuck to an old household machine. Anger and several hands threw their prayers against each other. For some reason, only one leg was missing.  Now, a small lie is crying. But there is no child in this room. The window is still wide open, and only the wind keeps carrying back the same sound.  Not being apologized to comes back more vividly than never being forgiven. Somewhere behind that silence, a folded word still seems to be breathing.   ---   Interpretive Poem｜The Rest of the Night  That night had been sealed by someone’s voice. Yet the key was nowhere to be found.  Did I scream? Or did I just hear something? Even that has blurred. The records turned damp and empty, and ethics, like a shadow on my back, crept back in from the distance.  What was left behind were words that never had names and silence that stood on a broken leg.  No one asks who was to blame anymore. But the sound of someone not apologizing still slips in through the crack of a window, bringing back a night that never had an ending.  ---  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 ","the drawer i thought i'd opened still looked closed no matter how many times i checked. only the sleeve of a white shirt seemed to sway at the end of the hallway. the memory of water sounds overlapped with the sound of broken dishes. that night, someone didn't call out a name but who that someone was remains undecided. they say someone had been keeping count. a nameless message took something away, and no one ever picked up where that night had left off. maybe it was me who yelled. or maybe someone in the next room was only mimicking what i thought i was doing. the sound of scolding rekindled some ideal stuck to an old household machine. anger and several hands threw their prayers against each other. for some reason, only one leg was missing. now, a small lie is crying. but there is no child in this room. the window is still wide open, and only the wind keeps carrying back the same sound. not being apologized to comes back more vividly than never being forgiven. somewhere behind that silence, a folded word still seems to be breathing. --- interpretive poemthe rest of the night that night had been sealed by someone's voice. yet the key was nowhere to be found. did i scream? or did i just hear something? even that has blurred. the records turned damp and empty, and ethics, like a shadow on my back, crept back in from the distance. what was left behind were words that never had names and silence that stood on a broken leg. no one asks who was to blame anymore. but the sound of someone not apologizing still slips in through the crack of a window, bringing back a night that never had an ending. ---"

"One Season (Free Verse, MLM)",crazyloonfan,"Caleb played baseball. Leo played soccer. Different fields. Same school. They only ever saw each other at the vending machines and in the nurse’s office when they both faked injuries to skip practice.  It started as banter. Leo made fun of the way Caleb chewed sunflower seeds. Caleb said soccer was just running in circles. But it turned into something else. Fast.  They kissed once after a late-night away game. Shoved into the back of a school bus, sweaty and shaking. No words — just heartbeats like thunder in their throats.  They didn’t talk about it. They didn’t have to. They knew.  It became a routine. Leo would sneak into the dugout after hours. Caleb would show up at the soccer field on days he didn’t have to. They weren’t public. But they weren’t pretending it wasn’t real, either.  Until Leo got scouted. Europe. Professional. A chance he couldn’t pass up.  He told Caleb under the bleachers. Said he was leaving in June. Said he wanted Caleb to come with him.  Caleb laughed. Not because it was funny but because it hurt too much to answer.  Baseball had always been his whole life. And so had Leo. But in different ways.  So they promised things they couldn’t keep. Said “we’ll figure it out.” Said “it’s not the end.”  But it was.  The night before Leo left, they laid on the pitcher’s mound. Leo pointed to the stars. Caleb pointed to his chest.  “You live here,” he said. “And it’s killing me.”  Leo cried. First time Caleb ever saw him do it.  And then he left.  They tried. For a while. But time zones are cruel. And silence grows heavy when love can’t breathe.  Caleb kept playing. Kept winning. But never smiled in the photos.  Leo posted less and less. Stopped responding. Until one day he just didn’t.  And Caleb still checks his DMs sometimes. Still wonders if Leo watches his games. Still keeps that damn soccer jersey folded in the back of his drawer like a ghost.  They only played one season.

They kissed the gold beneath her throat   not for worship —   but to taste the throne.  Desire dressed her in silk,   but it was longing that wove the thread.   A longing older than conquest,   sharper than any blade.  She did not burn.   She beckoned.   And in that gaze,   empires trembled.  She never begged for touch —   but the air around her ached.   Even the sun   lingered longer on her skin.  They wanted her voice   to echo their names.   But she spoke only in tides   and in the rise of want   no man could command.

The burning match,thepoet59,"  At the start it’s just a match no spark no life -nothing. Then with a sharp quick rush -it sparks a new burst of light- as if your looking at life it self.  It burns hot and you can smell  and feel the energy—it’s intoxicating. As if an addiction is taking you hostage.  As it burns it loses its rush -it’s no longer the bright mark it once was. The flaming arrow is about to land.   The match is at steady pace —still hot, needing fuel it begins to eat it self.  The match once hot enough to spread a wild fire is now meeting its end. One -final blow now all used up it begins to age, it loses its once-great threat.   Now all burnt up it shrivels. Leaving only charcoal and the smell of burnt sweet smoke.

The Jealous Boy,lordtube2,"I witnessed, I saw, I watched  You smiled… or maybe just spoke—  But even that shattered me like smoke.  With another boy—  Or should I call him the thief of my calm?  A shadow walking through my light,  A threat who dared to touch my peace,  To stain it with presence,  To tear it piece by piece.  How dare he!  Aren’t you my moon?  Yet he is the storm, the clouds,  Trying to hide you from my sight.  Aren’t you my sun?  Yet he resembles the eclipse,  Daring to steal your light.  Aren’t you my Queen?  Yet he’s another wicked monarch  Trying to win your heart.  While I—I’m just a loyal knight,  Hopelessly in love with a majestic Queen.  And if I were writing a tale,  He’d be the villain.  Evil burns in his gaze,  Darkness swirling around his name—  A shadow trying to drown my flame.  I wonder… from where he came,  Trying to steal you without any shame,  To overrule my presence  In the kingdom of your heart.  Yet to make it Blaze apart  But I—your knight—stand tall, unswayed,  Wounded, yes, but still unafraid.  I draw my sword of burning ache,  For love, for truth, and for your sake.  He fights with charm, with every lie,  While I fight with the tears I try to hide.  His armor: smiles, false golden grace—  But mine? The scars you left on my face.  A storm of doubt begins to pour,  As our blades clash on the palace floor.  Not for blood, nor pride, nor fame—  But for a heart that once spoke my name.  And though I fall, I fall with grace,  Still looking for your fading face.  If I must lose, let it be this way—  Fighting for love… and fading away.  Till I remembered the fire blazing in my heart  The jealousy that once tore me apart.  It felt like a poisoned arrow through my chest,  But even that pain stirred up the rest.  Enough to make me rise and stand,  And fight with strength he’ll never understand.  He can't feel what I once lived.  Jealousy was the fuel of my pain—  Like a thirsty fire,  Just needing to be maintained,  Yet burning me from the inside.  Yess, I get jealous over you.  ""Why should I be jealous?""  You asked—  How am I supposed not to be?!  You stopped the fight,  Calling it reckless and without a point.  Which made me wonder:  For whom did I sacrifice my life?  Then something woke me up—  Ahhh… he just asked for the way.  Turns out, he just asked for directions...  Just a boy… lost in the street, not in my heart.  The villain I created was only passing by.  Maybe I was driven by my thoughts.  Sorry, sorry…  It’s pointless, I guess.  But now you can see  How my jealousy over you truly is—  And know how deeply,  Hopelessly,  I'm in love with you.

Psychosmoothie,loceapeace,"  Someone’s mind was choking on its breath. A vehicle’s fluid crushed by a moonless night. A lament with magnetic weight lifted upward, bending the signpost that stood in its path. A damp impression of mismatched size was stabbed into a crease. A filthy tissue that stains the city’s embroidery is blown by wind, imitating a human heart.  There was nothing. The echo of bones, a fissure in twilight, a flower blooming on a decayed outdoor unit, a thin cloth hoisting an old woman. Words left unsaid built a house, and beside the sleeping silence, no words have been found for a long, long time.  The summer of truth ended. Run-over sashes were layered one atop another. High above, bundled misunderstandings gripped rusted tools. An apology in front of the hospital. A business card discarded on the street soaked in oil, absorbing scenery, writhing in pain from a neurotoxin lodged in its throat.  This morning, a sunken lie was poured into the sink. Until it dried, the body remained motionless. A pale contour, linked by a white severance deep in the eyes, was hidden behind a switch.  In front of a popular shop, torn apart by shadow, coins spilled from a wound were gathered by passersby. On hands stained by the blackness of blood, they searched for yesterday. Before a fallen memory, a star-shaped cookie offered in boredom— several points were broken. And as if digging the floor of reason, a memory returned of losing the residue of dignity near the elbow.  A greened building collapsed with a dull sound. Steel beams shaped like rabbits swimming in the sky melted. Several pardons squirmed within the cracks of a wall.  At the end of spring, a black fog transformed by a mochi-like regret living in driftwood. By the time it was inhaled through the nose and exhaled from the mouth, a parent bird had passed someone’s consciousness to its chicks, and looked this way with hollow eyes—smiling.    ---    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/RM2ktsnuJc  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/hiN2lA5aE7 ","someone's mind was choking on its breath. a vehicle's fluid crushed by a moonless night. a lament with magnetic weight lifted upward, bending the signpost that stood in its path. a damp impression of mismatched size was stabbed into a crease. a filthy tissue that stains the city's embroidery is blown by wind, imitating a human heart. there was nothing. the echo of bones, a fissure in twilight, a flower blooming on a decayed outdoor unit, a thin cloth hoisting an old woman. words left unsaid built a house, and beside the sleeping silence, no words have been found for a long, long time. the summer of truth ended. run-over sashes were layered one atop another. high above, bundled misunderstandings gripped rusted tools. an apology in front of the hospital. a business card discarded on the street soaked in oil, absorbing scenery, writhing in pain from a neurotoxin lodged in its throat. this morning, a sunken lie was poured into the sink. until it dried, the body remained motionless. a pale contour, linked by a white severance deep in the eyes, was hidden behind a switch. in front of a popular shop, torn apart by shadow, coins spilled from a wound were gathered by passersby. on hands stained by the blackness of blood, they searched for yesterday. before a fallen memory, a star-shaped cookie offered in boredom several points were broken. and as if digging the floor of reason, a memory returned of losing the residue of dignity near the elbow. a greened building collapsed with a dull sound. steel beams shaped like rabbits swimming in the sky melted. several pardons squirmed within the cracks of a wall. at the end of spring, a black fog transformed by a mochi-like regret living in driftwood. by the time it was inhaled through the nose and exhaled from the mouth, a parent bird had passed someone's consciousness to its chicks, and looked this way with hollow eyessmiling. ---"
First poem,RainAggravating1575,"[First time writing a poem(I have written songs before but no poems)] ___  Once a lake of compassion.  Bright.  In the blues, I saw love;  In the white foam, I saw promise;  In the tide, I saw passion;  In the ripples, I saw hope, a budding aspiration of better;  now dead—  Now dissolved.  The blues bled crimson.  For all good things must end, so too did the blues.  Yet, subsist I cannot.   This hollow burden consumes me forever, as I witness the last spark face inevitable.  The beating of the lake wanes.  The flow of life ebbs into death.  Silence.  For all good things must come to an end… I ponder why the unwelcome things endure.  This world, cast to shadow—  I wonder.  The lake runs dry,   yet remains my sadness;  Grieving,  over the soul now lost, the heart now faded away.

Echoes of a Broken Shade,PoetryCharm,"Another betrayal struck him today,   A familiar chuckle echoing dismay;   Still haunted by wounds of the past undone,   One more heartbreak was far too much to shun.  He sighed as he wandered down the street,   Then spied his shadow at his feet;   For a moment hope stirred within his chest—   This silent friend he trusted best.  Yet again his heart was rent in two,   As his shadow, too, broke the truth it knew;   When twilight fell and darkness reigned supreme,   That loyal echo shattered its own dream.  Isolated and weary beneath the starry gleam,   He waited while sorrow flowed like a stream;   Tears poured unbidden, a relentless tap,   As he bowed his head deep into his lap.  At last, he slept through an endless night,   Dried tears glimmering in the pale moonlight;   The hours raced swiftly, faster than before,   Until dawn’s first glow lured him to the shore.  Once more alone in silence’s embrace,   The calm of the waves restored a fragile grace;   When the sun ascended high in the sky,   His shadow reappeared—there, standing by.  Rubbing his eyes in a mix of hope and despair,   He murmured, “Why’d you vanish into thin air?   When moonlit city streets still shone so bright,   Why stray away, leaving me at night?”  The shadow smiled and gently took his hand,   Inviting him to rest upon the land;   “I’m with you from dawn until dusk’s decline,   Then forced apart—as seed departs its husk, divine.”  “So you remain with me throughout the day,   But at night, you simply fade away?”   That tender query brought a bittersweet smile,   Even as he wandered deeper in the loneliness' aisle.  Consoling him, the shadow softly spoke,   “Though fate compels our nightly yoke,   Call on your heart—and I shall reappear,   As husk nurtures seed, returning ever near.”  That night, at last, he slept in gentle peace,   No trace of sorrow, nor of heart’s release;   Like days before the cruel heartbreak’s sting,   A smile—though feigned—began to softly spring.  Now he knows that people often shatter,   Leaving bonds in ruins, hopes in tatters;   Yet in the steadfast friendship of his own shadow’s art,   He finds a solace, no betrayal can depart.

New Oasis,Wonderful-Wealth2761," I used to call every nomad a place. Followed their paths, ones not mine to trace. Maybe I was scared of the blistered sands, maybe it was easier to seek refuge in a stranger's hands.  Traded food for warmth, stories for water. Fumbled kindness for vows — all empty names I chased after, seeking shelter in the trades. A home in their eyes. Every adieu, a ""we’ll meet again."" Greedy, I’d pray for it twice.  I know nomads don’t build homes. Although still curious as to why. I still go around seeking a home — but no longer, I pry.  I learned it slow, riding the dusty dusk. Even I had days tired of chasing empty husks.  One such day, a stranger came. We had a trade — We traded wise, with virtue fair. And that day, the nomad in me dared to pass on quiet, to share no name there.  And I tasted it — the clean, strange and light of a bond unclaimed. Felt a thirst that wasn’t quenched by plenty.  I learned how beautiful the brief can be. How not every face needs be a memory. Funny how a whim could bring such change in me.  I learned to let the moment be my guiding grace, to not seek solace in every face.  But still a seeker I am, but my shelter is at peace whenever I am. My shelter is there, wherever I am.                    https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/v7Om41a0Mn   https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/qmeauIvMct","i used to call every nomad a place. followed their paths, ones not mine to trace. maybe i was scared of the blistered sands, maybe it was easier to seek refuge in a stranger's hands. traded food for warmth, stories for water. fumbled kindness for vows all empty names i chased after, seeking shelter in the trades. a home in their eyes. every adieu, a ""we'll meet again."" greedy, i'd pray for it twice. i know nomads don't build homes. although still curious as to why. i still go around seeking a home but no longer, i pry. i learned it slow, riding the dusty dusk. even i had days tired of chasing empty husks. one such day, a stranger came. we had a trade we traded wise, with virtue fair. and that day, the nomad in me dared to pass on quiet, to share no name there. and i tasted it the clean, strange and light of a bond unclaimed. felt a thirst that wasn't quenched by plenty. i learned how beautiful the brief can be. how not every face needs be a memory. funny how a whim could bring such change in me. i learned to let the moment be my guiding grace, to not seek solace in every face. but still a seeker i am, but my shelter is at peace whenever i am. my shelter is there, wherever i am."

Laurels for the Dim (original poem),ChapterNo5679," **Laurels for the Dim**   *By Silas Thorne*   *Dedicated to the damp-cheeked faithful of mediocrity’s choir*      I penned this for the gentle minds,  Whose rhymes do stagger, limp, and crawl—  Who weep in ink and call it art,  Yet know not meter, weight, nor fall.       Their quills, unsharpened by despair,  Spill syruped sighs with feathered grace;  And in their puddles, they declare—  “Behold! The bleeding soul’s embrace.”       They build their thrones of tepid lines,  With similes that sob and stall—  In lace they speak, yet draw no blade;  Each verse too timid to appall.       They weep of stars they’ve never seen,  And ache for wounds they’ve never earned—  Then toll their praise like chapel bells  At every echo vaguely learned.       I watched them toss up grief like grain,  Then feast upon the hollow husk—  Mistaking shadow cast by rain  For something tragic, deep, or just.       They scribble storms with plastic knives,  And crown each tantrum as a flame—  Then scratch their names on paper graves  As if the act alone means fame.       But lo—take heart, sweet porcelain choir!  You have your likes, your soft acclaim;  The empty bell still rings the hour,  And every feather bears a name.       So wear your garlands, dipped in tears,  Parade your pain, rehearsed and prim—  For even swine have mirrors, dears…  And I bestow you laurels—dim.  \[Feedback 1\](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/ff635O2NYf)    \[Feedback 2\](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/s/FyQWyusY2L)","by silas thorne dedicated to the damp-cheeked faithful of mediocrity's choir i penned this for the gentle minds, whose rhymes do stagger, limp, and crawl who weep in ink and call it art, yet know not meter, weight, nor fall. their quills, unsharpened by despair, spill syruped sighs with feathered grace; and in their puddles, they declare ""behold! the bleeding soul's embrace."" they build their thrones of tepid lines, with similes that sob and stall in lace they speak, yet draw no blade; each verse too timid to appall. they weep of stars they've never seen, and ache for wounds they've never earned then toll their praise like chapel bells at every echo vaguely learned. i watched them toss up grief like grain, then feast upon the hollow husk mistaking shadow cast by rain for something tragic, deep, or just. they scribble storms with plastic knives, and crown each tantrum as a flame then scratch their names on paper graves as if the act alone means fame. but lotake heart, sweet porcelain choir! you have your likes, your soft acclaim; the empty bell still rings the hour, and every feather bears a name. so wear your garlands, dipped in tears, parade your pain, rehearsed and prim for even swine have mirrors, dears... and i bestow you laurelsdim. 1 2"
Let the music play ( what’s a love song again ?),Willing-Director-560,"Do I even know what love is?  For me— love is staying. No matter what. No matter the pain, the numbness, the fading.  I felt it for a couple months. Then nothing. Is that normal? Isn’t it?  I try to figure it out— use bro as a personal diary, not too much, just enough. But I know— if his mask slips, if his character’s on trial, he’d sing. Let the flames ensue, hmm.  I don’t know what the fuck love is. I thought therapy might help— figure me out before I pour into anyone else. Apparently that was selfish.  I’m searching for a compass I never had. Someone said it would appear on the way— comical.  I know how to love a friend, unconditionally. But that’s weakness now, right?  Principle. That’s all we can trust. But principle is cold. And I’m cold, right?  That’s how they see me.  They say if everyone shares an opinion, it must be right. But what about the one who knows how to really hide?  Not just the face— but the heart.  Love isn’t in me. Not really. Not outside of me either.  They say I’m possessed for not wanting it. That it’s fear, that it’s demonic to walk away from something that hurts.  But I liked the girl. Told her up front— “I don’t know love. I’m trying to go to church. Trying to understand.”  I was told, “Take risks, prosper.” But what kind of man can’t juggle?  Yeah, I kept a part of me locked away. Didn’t want anyone near it. Not even her.  I’m not looking for sympathy.  She has my  inside her. I haven’t spoken to her in a while.  And I remembered— what happened that night.  But I’m a guy, right? I should suck it up, shut up, “be a man.” I accept the title: Evil. Leaving her alone like this?  I accept the title.

Self Love,BestGoonerEver,"I looked at myself in the semi-foggy bathroom mirror, held eye contact, and smiled.  Sure, my skin may be flaky, my eyebrows may be thinning, my hair may be on paid leave, maggots may be slithering out of my pores with a wet plop and cannonballing into the sink below, acne may be erupting pus, pus may be trickling down my face and into my mouth, my smile may be yellow and may radiate green cartoon stank tendrils, my tongue may be carpeted with everything I've eaten in the last week, and sure I may look like a SpongeBob close-up all in all, but I'm smiling because I finally learned to love myself... and love myself I did.

God I think you need glasses ( I’m not Job),Willing-Director-560,"God— why you making it so hard? And you, man downstairs— you too?  I ordered the one thing that could take me from this realm peacefully. But you didn’t allow it, did you?  You delayed it by a week. Then within that week you planted hope in my heart through familiar faces.  Which was beautiful— I’ll admit. But cruel.  Because the method I was going to use? A myth. Sacré bleu, for real.  Is this a practical joke?  Man downstairs— I know you don’t like me. Or my anima. Wouldn’t that mean you’d help me end it? But no. You sit still.  Why am I at the crossroads again? I made my choice. Why can’t I take it?  It feels like a spit in the face— to still be here withering. Lingering.  I’ve got hate, yeah. But it fades. I love everyone, and I wish them well, for real.  …wait. Is this a Job situation, God? WTF.  Is that what this is? That’s why neither of you are letting me leave, isn’t it?  I told you— I’m not Job. Not Joseph. Not David.  I’m Sage. The one and only.  God—why you gotta do me like that? Surely—remove this from me.  I’m not no prophet. I’ve walked through darkness. I’m not worthy.  But even as I write that— I hear you.  “You are just right, like Goldilocks and the porridge.” Damn.  It shouldn’t be this hard to leave this realm. Let me be like Enoch— just come up for a sec.  Or at least let them know I’m anointed. (Not that I even care for that anymore.)  Just— remove my existence. Let me be with You.  The angelic realm sounds kind of cool. Yo, Michael— let me take a swing of the sword.  Gabriel, you got words for me?  David— can we talk about this heartache thing?  Joseph, explain these dreams I’ve been having.  Cherubim— what did they do when those angels fell?  What did they see? What did they show? How did they pollute the earth so?  God— either confirm what I’m saying or bring me to You for a moment. Just a second.  You said not to test You… but You know me. I’m stubborn.  So if not You— I’ll try purgatory. I’ll walk to the veil and try to touch it with my own physical hand.  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lhlqbj/comment/mz4ymcb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button  https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1lhgo7n/comment/mz4z6at/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button ","god why you making it so hard? and you, man downstairs you too? i ordered the one thing that could take me from this realm peacefully. but you didn't allow it, did you? you delayed it by a week. then within that week you planted hope in my heart through familiar faces. which was beautiful i'll admit. but cruel. because the method i was going to use? a myth. sacre bleu, for real. is this a practical joke? man downstairs i know you don't like me. or my anima. wouldn't that mean you'd help me end it? but no. you sit still. why am i at the crossroads again? i made my choice. why can't i take it? it feels like a spit in the face to still be here withering. lingering. i've got hate, yeah. but it fades. i love everyone, and i wish them well, for real. ...wait. is this a job situation, god? wtf. is that what this is? that's why neither of you are letting me leave, isn't it? i told you i'm not job. not joseph. not david. i'm sage. the one and only. godwhy you gotta do me like that? surelyremove this from me. i'm not no prophet. i've walked through darkness. i'm not worthy. but even as i write that i hear you.
