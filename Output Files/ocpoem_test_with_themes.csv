"you fall into a puddle of resentment and tears. your life's being soaked with all your worst fears. grasping at reality, trying to make sense everything feels like a lie, left in the dark, in suspense. the puddle grows deeper, love crumbles you drown. the water's at your knees, rising fast, pulling down. the puddle starts to whisper; you slowly become friends. it hisses, ""be angry, lash out,"" but your conscience transcends. don't become a victim of the puddle's abyss. stay true to your heart that's where you'll find bliss. your values are strong, though the puddle is deep. just keep above water, till you're ready to leap. you grab for the ledge, pulling yourself free. the puddle clings to your ankles but you kick, break, and breathe. overcome with emotion, you let go you're free. the puddle melts away, and at last, you see no puddle's too deep, though it feels without end. you're stronger than you know all wounds can mend.","['struggle and resilience', 'emotional drowning', 'hope and recovery', 'inner conflict', 'self-liberation']"
