comments note poem about friendship breakup, don't share this outside of reddit december the sixth it was december the sixth the day my favorite album is going to come out it was december the sixth the day you're going to turn 15 it was december the sixth that i marked on my calendar way before october and look at every time i need some day to look forward to it was december the sixth when i turn to my friends sitting around telling them it was your birthday they said "i didn't know that" and i felt so proud it was december the sixth when i was so excited to look for you to say be the first to say "happy birthday" it was december the sixth that you told me i wasn't the first, someone else is it is december the sixth i will think of every time someone tell me they're a sagittarius it is december the sixth i will think of whenever someone tell me they never see me so reckless it is december the sixth i will think of every time i gaze out the health center window after my sleep, the shadow always waiting and how later people are going to ask where he went and "to find summer" they will say it is december the sixth i will think of every time 1989 starts playing and think about how we sang together in the hallways on our walks to the labs it is december the sixth i will think of when i see a table of boys sitting together in art class, with their paintbrushes and color pencils, exclaiming and laughing it is december the sixth i will think of when one of the boys looked at me and laughed so cynically, so harmlessly, at least that is what they thought it is december the sixth i will think of when you laughed with them at me, so pridefully it is december the sixth, when after that, i grabbed you and ask what you said and if it was something funny about me it was december the sixth when all the boys circled me and said "she doesn't know?" with that innocent smirk, at least that's what they thought it is december the sixth when you told me, it was nothing, then that you were forced, they made you do it, the fault was all theirs, all theirs, the pride was all theirs, it wasn't fair, you would say something else if you had a choice if you had another choice your choice at least that was what you thought because after december the sixth you were better friends with them, using the slangs you didn't understand, spreading rumors about you and her dating after december the sixth you loved winter, the scarfs, the trench coats, holding onto the hand the boy you secretly had a crush on, singing last christmas because you might have a better shot at christmas, at least that was what you thought after december the sixth you know you were going to transfer, you stuck with new people, the reels stopped, the calls stopped after december the sixth you stopped looking for summer stopped looking for the warning gave, the lessons told, messages secretly exchanged but it is not december the sixth anymore i stopped looking too, not in hallways, not in classrooms, not at the messages not in the songs, not in front of health center glasses not in restaurants you said we could go to once your mom let you go out or in that hospital you say we can open together when we're both grown up because december the sixth i left first, turned away first, stared at the ground before my eyes meets yours in december before the sixth i might still look at someone with long lashes and think of the day that will come in a few days or lilies we saw in the lab for some experiment we didn't figure out what was about my google password you set 2 years ago with the word we made up so we wouldn't forget the chemistry formula i still cannot forget but next december the sixth when someone asks me about that best friend i used to have i can finally say with as much pride as sadness "it was my choice, i was the first"

POEM:
i met a woman recently in a warm land beneath perfect skies. we barely spoke. just a few looks, a few smiles, and a conversation in broken languages, but something about her shook me to my core. i felt a connection that frightened me, because i'm already in a loving relationship and i felt like i was on the edge of something that risked it all. this poem is about longing. that deep, aching longing. about the what ifs. about the intoxicating pull of another possible life, the kind you glimpse only briefly before returning to your own. it's about seeing that fantasy so very clearly and then somehow, slowly and painfully, making your way back home. i am, i think, 'bout halfway home i have no map or watch to mark the lonely journey through the dark from heady nights and starry skies, the man i could be in your eyes, back to washing up and laundry day and real life and cloudy grey i mourn the man i left behind it's like he died, yet still inside he only lived inside your eyes on heady nights under starry skies now again the man i've always been the one just longing to be seen i think of frost, the other path the one that echoes with your laugh of winks and smiles and playful looks bishop taking kingside rook i longed, i cried, i beat my breast and screamed your name in silence, yet i took the other path i know not how long left to go present body, mind halfway home sometimes i walk, sometimes i sail sometimes i just try to keep my head above water she doesn't know. at least not all of quite how far i had to fall back to her arms, routine embrace but my mind is in another place a place of wonder, of sweet "what if" of words unsaid and lips unkissed it was real for me. was it for you? would i find peace even if i knew? a slip of paper, held like gold with a door left open, things untold a scribbled number, passed through a friend and cherished right till journey's end i resist with love - for you and her for a moment that would break the moment i touched it it's taken time, it will take more but soon i'll be back at the door of something real, something mine something built with care and time and love and smiles and tears and strife something i'd choose in every life but for now, i am i think 'bout halfway home

POEM:
do i even know what love is? for me love is staying. no matter what. no matter the pain, the numbness, the fading. i felt it for a couple months. then nothing. is that normal? isn't it? i try to figure it out use bro as a personal diary, not too much, just enough. but i know if his mask slips, if his character's on trial, he'd sing. let the flames ensue, hmm. i don't know what the fuck love is. i thought therapy might help figure me out before i pour into anyone else. apparently that was selfish. i'm searching for a compass i never had. someone said it would appear on the way comical. i know how to love a friend, unconditionally. but that's weakness now, right? principle. that's all we can trust. but principle is cold. and i'm cold, right? that's how they see me. they say if everyone shares an opinion, it must be right. but what about the one who knows how to really hide? not just the face but the heart. love isn't in me. not really. not outside of me either. they say i'm possessed for not wanting it. that it's fear, that it's demonic to walk away from something that hurts. but i liked the girl. told her up front "i don't know love. i'm trying to go to church. trying to understand." i was told, "take risks, prosper." but what kind of man can't juggle? yeah, i kept a part of me locked away. didn't want anyone near it. not even her. i'm not looking for sympathy. she has my inside her. i haven't spoken to her in a while. and i remembered what happened that night. but i'm a guy, right? i should suck it up, shut up, "be a man." i accept the title evil. leaving her alone like this? i accept the title. they don't know what happened. not really. the ones yelling "non-clarity" never saw the night play out. no one's touched me since. and not because i'm strong. just broken in a way i haven't mapped yet. i'm not perfect. never claimed to be. so lock me in my cell four corners, no windows. but just give me one thing let the music play. just let it fucking play.

POEM:
the night unfurls like a velvet curtain, heavy and dark, a shroud against the world, igniting our spark. the air hums thick, a heady wine of anticipation, a stage for us alone, trembling with sensation. your skin glows caramel, a silken map to roam, warm beneath my fingers, a hearth, a home. the curve of your hips sings a siren's refrain, while your eyesdeep wellspull me in again. shadows cloak the room, save the moon's pale gleam, silver tracing your form, a living dream. jasmine weaves through the air, a sultry tease, blending with your scentwild, raw, a breeze. my heart thuds primal, a drumbeat's call, as i step closer, pinned by your thrall. your breath hitches soft, a gasp so slight, when my hands find your skin in the hush of night. the dance begins i trace your jaw's edge, a sculptor's line, down the slope of your neck, tender, divine. your lips bloom open, ripe with heat, a nectar-sweet kiss where our hungers meet. tongues clash and curl, a symphony's rise, a crescendo of want beneath moonlit skies. your nails carve my back, a feral plea, stripping our barriers, setting us free. clothes drift away, like leaves in fall, unveiling your beauty, answering my call. your breasts rise proud, soft peaks to claim, i cradle their weight, whispering your name. nipples tauten, eager for my care, i bend to taste them, lingering there. your moans spill forth, a melody's thread, as i tease and suckle, your pleasure fed. descent into bliss kisses trail lower, a pilgrim's quest, across your stomach, trembling, blessed. to the cradle of your thighs i roam, where desire blossoms, a sacred home. a flower unfurls, petals slick with dew, your musk fills meearthy, true. my tongue maps circles, a tender art, diving into your core, your beating heart. your hips surge wild, chasing my pace, i feast and linger, lost in your grace. your cries pierce the dark, sharp and sweet, teetering on the edge, where ecstasy meets. i pull you back, then push once more, teasing the brink, a game to adore. until you plead, voice raw with need, and i grant releasea shattering creed. you break apart, a storm's delight, waves of rapture flooding the night. your body quakes, a vision so rare, i watch, enthralled, as you float there. union and fire yet the dance endures, our tale unwinds, i rise to join you, our fates aligned. at your threshold i pause, slick and bold, then thrust within, a story told. you gasp at the fullness, the searing flame, our bodies meld, no space, no shame. we sway as one, a timeless beat, each motion a vow where our souls meet. your legs lock tight, drawing me in, sweat beads and blends, skin on skin. faster we climb, a fevered race, nails rake my flesh, marking your place. the summit nears, a roaring tide, we chase it fierce, side by side. you clench around me, a pulsing grip, i spill within, a boundless slip. afterglow and renewal we collapse entwined, breathless, spent, a tangle of limbs, our energies lent. the silence hums with our fading sighs, basking in the glow where passion lies. but embers flicker, desire reborn, with you, my love, i'm never forlorn. again we stir, a fresh verse to weave, in this endless tale we both believe. through the night we roam, wild and free, from tender touch to fierce decree. your body's my shrine, my endless muse, a fire we stoke, never to lose. dawn's embrace as dawn streaks gold across the sky, we drift to sleep, you and i. yet dreams still burn with vivid hue, for my heart, my soul, belong to you. when sunlight spills, we'll rise once more, to chase the flames we can't ignore. our love's a blaze, eternal, vast, a poem of passion, forever cast. --- this is our song, our vivid art, a testament to the fire in our heart. for as long as we live, as long as we breathe, this desire, this love, we'll never leave. --- this is an original poem. is welcome! i'm looking for on imagery and pacing 1 2

POEM:
mouth sounds and bl00d shed this is written for spoken word i thinl it is seven pm and i am trying to sleep, so i plug my earbuds and lay still. the asmr video on my screen tells me i am on a flight. she holds a single tortilla says she'll break it for everybody on board and in that same calm voice whispers where is jesus when you need him? laughter comes first and then my brows crease, where is jesus when you need him? where is jesus now that children are running after water trucks hoping a drop falls off to gather the congealed sand and suck the wet grit for their first taste of the day? where is jesus when seven year old boys are running to spots where bombs are sure to be dropped because that's where food is being shared? brother needs this backpack to not be empty. even if the bomb is set for 230, he'll wait till 3- baby sister is waiting. her stomach, drier than khan yunis nothing left to pad her ribs, nothing left to fool hunger even for a while. the 12-mile walk back to her, is too long to make with the weight of an empty bag on his shoulder. because the hope for a spoon of plain lentils in the backpack-turned-bowl far outweighs the fear of death. because death now feels like a long awaited family reunion. because he has watched their playmates body parts rain down along with concrete, metal, whatever buildings leave behind when they are forced to meet the ground. along with shrapnel, along with their mother. he does not know if he is waiting for food or for bomb. but he knows baby sister sits alone, baby sister is waiting. baby sister says after we die, will i hear your voice? i turn the volume up and the bombs get louder. baby sister's voice echoes under my binaural beats. where is jesus when you need him? now we need him to turn 5 weevil infested flatbreads into 500. to bring 18inch bodies back from the dead. to blind the child so they don't have to see their mother's unborn child outside her body, they went searching only for her body. where is this blessed saviour when you need him? the asmrtist says we should check if there's a priest on board, says somebody will most likely need their last rites read. every 10 minutes, someone along the strip needs a priest where is jesus when parents have to hold whatever part of their child is visible under the rubble, have to lie and tell them they can get them out while convincing the disembodied voice to say the shahada. the asmrtist says sleep tight and i hear bear witness. i dig my earbuds deeper in my ears like maybe i can help them drown out the sounds of drones and bombs and bodies begging for death. i squeeze into myself and i am on that ground, lying in that tent with baby sister. we are waiting for brother. we are waiting for jesus to show up now he is needed. or is it that all he too can do is press all four buttons on the screen and pray the algorithm is there when you need it? side note i am open to all forms of critism, you dont have to be nice ill apreciate your honesty, thanks! and if your curious, i make this and my other pieces into spokenword videos on my youtube @sir mo nothingess ambition a house without windows

POEM:
i wrote this during a bit of an existential crisis to help myself through, and now i think back to it whenever i'm in a similar spot feel everything. don't flinch. don't blink. don't take a breath until it breaks your ribs open. when grief comes, don't ask it to leave. let it sit in your throat and rot something important. let it remind you you were touched once. you loved something that could be lost. how rare. how human. cry. cry so hard your jaw cramps. grovel in the dirt of it. sniff the shirts they left behind. text their number just to see the little "delivered." scream into the steering wheel. punch your own gut. this is not weakness. this is the cost of being real. and when joy arrives? don't just smile. howl. fall to your knees like it's a god and you are a filthy, unworthy thing lucky to kneel in its presence. laugh until your stomach bruises. feel every giggle like it's forbidden. let it embarrass you. when you're angry, be furious. tear the world to pieces in your imagination. go red. go hot. make it mean something. you don't get these moments twice. no encore. no reset. you will not be here again. there is no heaven. there is no after. there is this. this breath. this ache. this tuesday. this slow sip of water when you've been crying too hard to swallow. this look in their eyes before they leave. this skin you were given once and only once. religion says "transcend." i say descend. go deeper. get filthy in your own soul. you were born to feel. to flinch and fall and rise again without anyone's permission. the only thing worse than heartbreak is never having a heart worth breaking. so when the pain comes don't cope. don't numb. don't bury. bask. this is your one chance to suffer beautifully. to weep with dignity. to feel it all and call it holy. and when you die when the lights go out and you return to that gorgeous, black silence let your last thought be this "i left nothing unfelt." links

POEM:
all i see? gaggles of humans laced with potential to build andor destroy. often times, building's done solo. destruction's executed in convoy. all i see? affirmations lost by people, found in places things. often times, making gods of possessions possesses clipped wings. all i see? a society of empty souls seeking fulfillment only they can own. often times, the masses fail to realize what they seek's outside of their phones. all i see? a full deck of kings reduced to their richards their "modest" size. often times, those sentiments change as c-notes wave before zealous eyes. all i see? dens filled with lionesses mourning their lost cubs. often times, the cords of camaraderie snap as awaited newborns enter bathtubs. all i see? me observing this behavior, knowing that i'm no better. often times, dreams of becoming change i want to see only come true if i get it together. so tell me, what do you all see? don't be afraid to speak your truth. often times, dialogues such as these empower our youth.
