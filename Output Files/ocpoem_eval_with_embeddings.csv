"i entered the garden with many plants to behold and yet the zinnias held my attention with many buds to yet unfold . their bright yellow hue shimmered bright in the sun with many dots of dew the beauty seemed second to none . as i gazed i saw myself in reflections the water held and as i tended to the plants many of the buds, others felled . i saw myself grasping at a bloom and as i did i changed and grew as drops pooled into my hands, my image grew bigger, and the flower stood, steadfast . petals of copper and gold sliced my fingers, and stories untold stained the liquid a view of red the life around me wilted, dead . i ran from the garden as rain poured unsure of what the forest had in store with unfamiliar paths to tread i clung to the piercing petals with dread . with fear in my heart that the flower was no more i fell to my knees and let myself roar as rain turned to snow, i gazed at the ice saw myself in the reflection and saw the price . having grasped too hard at the flower still whole the beauty i saw seemed merely dull . the blossom, set aside, drifted in the stream, and i yearned to follow, but knew it yet a dream, so i grasped the shard of glass gripping tight and steadfast . sharp edges cut yet again as i held tight to what had been but as i looked through i saw other flowers in the rivers maw . bright colors dotted the horizon my reflection showed potential for wizen- -ing up to what growth needs and how to let blooms grow amongst the trees . so with that view in hand i took one step in loamy sand with shifting ground underfoot i took my rose glasses off, another step i took. . to note zinnias symbolize friendships, enduring, and remembrance","['growth and change', 'beauty and pain', 'self-reflection and identity', 'letting go and acceptance', 'friendship and remembrance']","['growth and change', 'beauty and pain', 'self-reflection', 'loss and renewal', 'acceptance and letting go']",0.25,0.6428571428571429,0.4,0.4,0.8192579833565177
"hey you, who reads this late at night, with aching heart and fading light, still searching through the words you find for peace to soothe your weary mind. i see the shadows in your stare, the battles fought that none declare. you hide your pain, you wear your grin but storms still rage beneath your skin. you wonder if it's worth the fight, if dawn will ever follow night. but friend, you're here and that alone means seeds of strength in you have grown. you've faced the dark and not let go, you've moved through fire, rain, and snow. you're made of stories, grit, and flame no loss or scar can steal your name. so hey, you there, with soul worn thin, with battles fought both out and in don't let this world define your grace, you're more than scars, more than this place. i won't pretend it's always fair, but hope still lingers in the air. each breath you take's a rebel's song, a whisper that says, ""i belong."" you're not alone, though it feels so. you're not too much. you're not too low. and if you stumble, if you break that's proof you give more than take. so stand, or sit, or cry if need but know that simply you is freed. the fact you're here, despite the pain means you can rise and rise again 1 2","['hope and perseverance', 'inner strength and resilience', 'pain and healing', 'self-acceptance and worth', 'companionship and solidarity']","['inner strength', 'struggle and resilience', 'hope and perseverance', 'hidden pain', 'self-acceptance']",0.1111111111111111,0.5714285714285714,0.2,0.2,0.7276783593210805

"dear t.s. eliot- i wrote her the poem you didn't because you built your legacy, and left her without one it's ironic, isn't it? that i tattooed your words into the skin i still live inside. i clung to your poetry like it might be the only thing that would keep me alive. ""i said to my soul, be still..."" is etched on me forever, because i needed it. i longed for the stillness you wrote about- because the noise inside me wasn't something i could outrun, or out-pray, or outgrow. i believed you must've known what it felt like to fall apart quietly. to carry a mind that wouldn't behave. but i stumbled on the truth when i learned about her. and how you saw her only as a disruption- not a wife. not a person at all. you wrote of wastelands- then left her alone to rot in one. you said dried voices are quiet and meaningless. you said the world ends with a whimper, not a bang. was that some kind of grand poetic warning that you would let her world end quietly? did you wear those deliberate disguises you mentioned- of a rat's coat and a crow's skin- to hide the disdain you held for her? was that why you washed your hands of her in literary dust? you turned your anguish into stanzas, while hers stayed in hidden diaries- where she said you must have been kidnapped. the doctors who read her words called it schizophrenia. but i know all too well- that sometimes it's better to tell yourself literally anything, rather than that the man you truly loved had left you alone by choice. when you spoke of the hollow man- was he you? the one who wrote about ""the still point."" while she lived her life helplessly still. devastated and motionless- after she dried up, along with the ink from your pen that created your legacy. a legacy i once believed you deserved. because, surely- if someone could write so beautifully about ruin- they must know how to hold a shattered thing gently. but her broken pieces were only held in the subtext of poems that never made it into your four quartets. they still say you tucked her somewhere in between the lines of ash wednesday. and that it reads like the shadow of a man who knew what he'd done. but even then, you made repentance poetic. you asked to be cleansed, but not by her hands. and you never even called her by name. and to this day, i wear your words- ""i said to my soul be still, and wait without hope, for hope would be hope for the wrong thing."" i thought about removing them from my skin. they started to feel like they hated me, because they were yours. it felt like i had carved the signature of someone who would've left me behind, the second my pain became inconvenient. but i think i'll keep it. because honestly- the words still move me. i think they always will. but now, when someone asks about the poem stuck on my skin, i'll tell them about you. and i'll tell them about her too. but unlike you, i'll tell them everything. i won't leave her vague- not by name, and not by story. i'll tell them all about her- vivienne.","['literary legacy and silence', 'mental illness and misunderstanding', 'love and neglect', 'poetry as survival', 'truth and revelation']","['legacy and silence', 'mental turmoil', 'disguise and disdain', 'unrequited love', 'poetic repentance']",0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.5413113048143601
